McGuinness\\nStanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305\\nnoy@smi.stanford.edu   and    dlm@ksl.stanford.edu\\n1 Why develop an ontology?\\nIn recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in\\nthe domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of\\nArtificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have\\nbecome common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large\\ntaxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for\\nsale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is\\ndeveloping the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for\\nencoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching\\nfor information.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in\\nconjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by\\nextending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the\\nWeb (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies\\nthat domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for\\nexample, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED  (Price and\\nSpackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System\\n(Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For\\nexample, the United Nations Development Program and Dun & Bradstreet combined their\\nefforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and\\nservices (www.unspsc.org).\\nAn ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in\\na domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and\\nrelations among them.\\nWhy would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:\\n• To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or\\nsoftware agents\\n• To enable reuse of domain knowledge\\n• To make domain assumptions explicit\\n• To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge\\n• To analyze domain knowledge\\nSharing common understanding of the structure of information among people or software\\nagents  is one of the more common goals in developing ontologies (Musen 1992; Gruber\\n1993). For example, suppose several different Web sites contain medical information or\\nprovide medical e-commerce services. If these Web sites share and publish the same\\nunderlying ontology of the terms they all use, then computer agents can extract and\\naggregate information from these different sites. The agents can use this aggregated\\ninformation to answer user queries or as input data to other applications.\\nEnabling reuse of domain knowledge  was one of the driving forces behind recent surge in\\nontology research. For example, models for many different domains need to represent the\\nnotion of time. This representation includes the notions of time intervals, points in time,\\nrelative measures of time, and so on. If one group of researchers develops such an ontology\\nin detail, others can simply reuse it for their domains. Additionally, if we need to build a large', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2ontology, we can integrate several existing ontologies describing portions of the large\\ndomain. We can also reuse a general ontology, such as the UNSPSC ontology, and extend it\\nto describe our domain of interest.\\nMaking explicit domain assumptions underlying an implementation makes it possible to\\nchange these assumptions easily if our knowledge about the domain changes. Hard-coding\\nassumptions about the world in programming-language code makes these assumptions not\\nonly hard to find and understand but also hard to change, in particular for someone without\\nprogramming expertise. In addition, explicit specifications of domain knowledge are useful\\nfor new users who must learn what terms in the domain mean.  \\nSeparating the domain knowledge from the operational knowledge is another common use\\nof ontologies. We can describe a task of configuring a product from its components according\\nto a required specification and implement a program that does this configuration independent\\nof the products and components themselves (McGuinness and Wright 1998). We can then\\ndevelop an ontology of PC-components and characteristics and apply the algorithm to\\nconfigure made-to-order PCs. We can also use the same algorithm to configure elevators if\\nwe “feed” an elevator component ontology to it (Rothenfluh et al. 1996).\\nAnalyzing domain knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is\\navailable.  Formal analysis of terms is extremely valuable when both attempting to reuse\\nexisting ontologies and extending them (McGuinness et al. 2000).\\nOften an ontology of the domain is not a goal in itself. Developing an ontology is akin to\\ndefining a set of data and their structure for other programs to use. Problem-solving methods,\\ndomain-independent applications, and software agents use ontologies and knowledge bases\\nbuilt from ontologies as data. For example, in this paper we develop an ontology of wine and\\nfood and appropriate combinations of wine with meals. This ontology can then be used as a\\nbasis for some applications in a suite of restaurant-managing tools: One application could\\ncreate wine suggestions for the menu of the day or answer queries of waiters and customers.\\nAnother application could analyze an inventory list of a wine cellar and suggest which wine\\ncategories to expand and which particular wines to purchase for upcoming menus or\\ncookbooks.\\nAbout this guide\\nWe build on our experience using Protégé-2000 (Protege 2000) , Ontolingua (Ontolingua\\n1997) , and Chimaera (Chimaera 2000)  as ontology-editing environments. In this guide, we\\nuse Protégé-2000 for our examples.\\nThe wine and food example that we use throughout this guide is loosely based on an example\\nknowledge base presented in a paper describing CLASSIC—a knowledge-representation\\nsystem based on a description-logics approach (Brachman et al. 1991) . The CLASSIC tutorial\\n(McGuinness et al. 1994)  has developed this example further. Protégé-2000 and other\\nframe-based systems describe ontologies declaratively, stating explicitly what the class\\nhierarchy is and to which classes individuals belong.\\nSome ontology-design ideas in this guide originated from the literature on object-oriented\\ndesign (Rumbaugh et al. 1991; Booch et al. 1997). However, ontology development is\\ndifferent from designing classes and relations in object-oriented programming. Object-\\noriented programming centers primarily around methods on classes—a programmer makes\\ndesign decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontology designer\\nmakes these decisions based on the structural  properties of a class. As a result, a class\\nstructure and relations among classes in an ontology are different from the structure for a\\nsimilar domain in an object-oriented program.\\nIt is impossible to cover all the issues that an ontology developer may need to grapple with\\nand we are not trying to address all of them in this guide. Instead, we try to provide a starting\\npoint; an initial guide that would help a new ontology designer to develop ontologies.

       " Document(page_content='3end, we suggest places to look for explanations of more complicated structures and design\\nmechanisms if the domain requires them.\\nFinally, there is no single correct ontology-design methodology and we did not attempt to\\ndefine one. The ideas that we present here are the ones that we found useful in our own\\nontology-development experience. At the end of this guide we suggest a list of references for\\nalternative methodologies.\\n2 What is in an ontology?\\nThe Artificial-Intelligence literature contains many definitions of an ontology; many of\\nthese contradict one another. For the purposes of this guide an ontology  is a formal explicit\\ndescription of concepts in a domain of discourse (classes (sometimes called concepts )),\\nproperties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept (slots\\n(sometimes called  roles or properties )), and restrictions on slots (facets (sometimes called\\nrole restrictions )). An ontology together with a set of individual instances  of classes\\nconstitutes a knowledge base . In reality, there is a fine line where the ontology ends and\\nthe knowledge base begins.\\nClasses are the focus of most ontologies. Classes describe concepts in the domain. For\\nexample, a class of wines represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class. The\\nBordeaux wine in the glass in front of you while you read this document is an instance of the\\nclass of Bordeaux wines. A class can have subclasses  that represent concepts that are more\\nspecific than the superclass. For example, we can divide the class of all wines into red, white,\\nand rosé wines. Alternatively, we can divide a class of all wines into sparkling and non-\\nsparkling wines.  \\nSlots  describe properties of classes and instances: Château Lafite Rothschild\\nPauillac  wine has a full body; it is produced by the Château Lafite Rothschild\\nwinery. We have two slots describing the wine in this example: the slot body with the value\\nfull and the slot maker with the value Château Lafite Rothschild  winery. At the\\nclass level, we can say that instances of the class Wine will have slots describing their\\nflavor, body, sugar level, the maker of the wine and so on.1\\nAll instances of the class Wine, and its subclass Pauillac, have a slot maker the value of\\nwhich is an instance of the class Winery (Figure 1). All instances of the class Winery have a\\nslot produces  that refers to all the wines (instances of the class Wine and its subclasses)\\nthat the winery produces.\\nIn practical terms, developing an ontology includes:\\n• defining classes in the ontology,\\n• arranging the classes in a taxonomic (subclass–superclass) hierarchy,\\n• defining slots and describing allowed values for these slots,\\n• filling in the values for slots for instances.\\nWe can then create a knowledge base by defining individual instances of these classes filling in\\nspecific slot value information and additional slot restrictions.\\n                                                1 We capitalize class names and start slot names with low-case letters. We also use typewriter font  for\\nall terms from the example ontology.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Direct links represent slots and internal links such as instance-of\\nand subclass-of.\\n3 A Simple Knowledge-Engineering Methodology\\nAs we said earlier, there is no one “correct” way or methodology for developing ontologies.\\nHere we discuss general issues to consider and offer one possible process for developing an\\nontology. We describe an iterative approach to ontology development: we start with a rough\\nfirst pass at the ontology. We then revise and refine the evolving ontology and fill in the\\ndetails. Along the way, we discuss the modeling decisions that a designer needs to make, as\\nwell as the pros, cons, and implications of different solutions.\\nFirst, we would like to emphasize some fundamental rules in ontology design to which we will\\nrefer many times. These rules may seem rather dogmatic. They can help, however, to make\\ndesign decisions in many cases.\\n1) There is no one correct way to model a domain— there are always\\nviable alternatives. The best solution almost always depends on the\\napplication that you have in mind and the extensions that you anticipate.\\n2) Ontology development is necessarily an iterative process.\\n3) Concepts in the ontology should be close to objects (physical or logical)\\nand relationships in your domain of interest. These are most likely to be\\nnouns (objects) or verbs (relationships) in sentences that describe your\\ndomain.\\nThat is, deciding what we are going to use the ontology for, and how detailed or general the\\nontology is going to be will guide many of the modeling decisions down the road. Among\\nseveral viable alternatives, we will need to determine which one would work better for the\\nprojected task, be more intuitive, more extensible, and more maintainable. We also need to\\nremember that an ontology is a model of reality of the world and the concepts in the\\nontology must reflect this reality. After we define an initial version of the ontology, we can\\nevaluate and debug it by using it in applications or problem-solving methods or by discussing\\nit with experts in the field, or both. As a result, we will almost certainly need to revise the\\ninitial ontology. This process of iterative design will likely continue through the entire\\nlifecycle of the ontology.\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5Step 1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology\\nWe suggest starting the development of an ontology by defining its domain and scope. That\\nis, answer several basic questions:\\n• What is the domain that the ontology will cover?\\n• For what we are going to use the ontology?\\n• For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?\\n• Who will use and maintain the ontology?\\nThe answers to these questions may change during the ontology-design process, but at any\\ngiven time they help limit the scope of the model.\\nConsider the ontology of wine and food that we introduced earlier. Representation of food\\nand wines is the domain of the ontology. We plan to use this ontology for the applications\\nthat suggest good combinations of wines and food.\\nNaturally, the concepts describing different types of wines, main food types, the notion of a\\ngood combination of wine and food and a bad combination will figure into our ontology. At\\nthe same time, it is unlikely that the ontology will include concepts for managing inventory\\nin a winery or employees in a restaurant even though these concepts are somewhat related to\\nthe notions of wine and food.\\nIf the ontology we are designing will be used to assist in natural language processing of articles\\nin wine magazines, it may be important to include synonyms and part-of-speech information\\nfor concepts in the ontology. If the ontology will be used to help restaurant customers decide\\nwhich wine to order, we need to include retail-pricing information.  If it is used for wine\\nbuyers in stocking a wine cellar, wholesale pricing and availability may be necessary.  If the\\npeople who will maintain the ontology describe the domain in a language that is different\\nfrom the language of the ontology users, we may need to provide the mapping between the\\nlanguages.\\nCompetency questions.\\nOne of the ways to determine the scope of the ontology is to sketch a list of questions that a\\nknowledge base based on the ontology should be able to answer, competency questions\\n(Gruninger and Fox 1995) . These questions will serve as the litmus test later: Does the\\nontology contain enough information to answer these types of questions? Do the answers\\nrequire a particular level of detail or representation of a particular area? These competency\\nquestions are just a sketch and do not need to be exhaustive.\\nIn the wine and food domain, the following are the possible competency questions:\\n• Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?\\n• Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?\\n• Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?\\n• What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?\\n• Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?\\n• Does a bouquet or body of a specific wine change with vintage year?\\n• What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?\\nJudging from this list of questions, the ontology will include the information on various wine\\ncharacteristics and wine types, vintage years—good and bad ones—classifications of foods\\nthat matter for choosing an appropriate wine, recommended combinations of wine and food.\\nStep 2. Consider reusing existing ontologies\\nIt is almost always worth considering what someone else has done and checking if we can\\nrefine and extend existing sources for our particular domain and task.

       " Document(page_content='6ontologies may be a requirement if our system needs to interact with other applications that\\nhave already committed to particular ontologies or controlled vocabularies.  Many ontologies\\nare already available in electronic form and can be imported into an ontology-development\\nenvironment that you are using. The formalism in which an ontology is expressed often does\\nnot matter, since many knowledge-representation systems can import and export ontologies.\\nEven if a knowledge-representation system cannot work directly with a particular formalism,\\nthe task of translating an ontology from one formalism to another is usually not a difficult\\none.\\nThere are libraries of reusable ontologies on the Web and in the literature. For example, we\\ncan use the Ontolingua ontology library (http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/software/ontolingua/) orthe DAML ontology library (http://www.daml.org/ontologies/).  There are also a number ofpublicly available commercial ontologies (e.g., UNSPSC (www.unspsc.org), RosettaNet\\n(www.rosettanet.org), DMOZ (www.dmoz.org)).\\nFor example, a knowledge base of French wines may already exist. If we can import this\\nknowledge base and the ontology on which it is based, we will have not only the classification\\nof French wines but also the first pass at the classification of wine characteristics used to\\ndistinguish and describe the wines. Lists of wine properties may already be available from\\ncommercial Web sites such as www.wines.com that customers consider use to buy wines.For this guide however we will assume that no relevant ontologies already exist and start\\ndeveloping the ontology from scratch.\\nStep 3. Enumerate important terms in the ontology\\nIt is useful to write down a list of all terms we would like either to make statements about or\\nto explain to a user. What are the terms we would like to talk about? What properties do\\nthose terms have? What would we like to say about those terms? For example, important\\nwine-related terms will include wine, grape, winery, location , a wine’s color,\\nbody, flavor and sugar content; different types of food, such as fish and red\\nmeat; subtypes of wine such as white wine, and so on. Initially, it is important to get a\\ncomprehensive list of terms without worrying about overlap between concepts they\\nrepresent, relations among the terms, or any properties that the concepts may have, or\\nwhether the concepts are classes or slots.\\nThe next two steps—developing the class hierarchy and defining properties of concepts\\n(slots)—are closely intertwined. It is hard to do one of them first and then do the other.\\nTypically, we create a few definitions of the concepts in the hierarchy and then continue by\\ndescribing properties of these concepts and so on. These two steps are also the most\\nimportant steps in the ontology-design process. We will describe them here briefly and then\\nspend the next two sections discussing the more complicated issues that need to be\\nconsidered, common pitfalls, decisions to make, and so on.\\nStep 4. Define the classes and the class hierarchy\\nThere are several possible approaches in developing a class hierarchy (Uschold and\\nGruninger 1996) :\\n• A top-down  development process starts with the definition of the most general\\nconcepts in the domain and subsequent specialization of the concepts. For example,\\nwe can start with creating classes for the general concepts of Wine and Food. Then\\nwe specialize the Wine class by creating some of its subclasses: White wine, Red\\nwine, Rosé wine. We can further categorize the Red wine class, for example,\\ninto Syrah, Red Burgundy , Cabernet Sauvignon , and so on.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='7• A bottom-up  development process starts with the definition of the most specific\\nclasses, the leaves of the hierarchy, with subsequent grouping of these classes into\\nmore general concepts. For example, we start by defining classes for Pauillac  and\\nMargaux wines. We then create a common superclass for these two\\nclasses— Medoc—which in turn is a subclass of Bordeaux .\\n• A combination  development process is a combination of the top-down and bottom-\\nup approaches: We define the more salient concepts first and then generalize and\\nspecialize them appropriately. We might start with a few top-level concepts such as\\nWine, and a few specific concepts, such as Margaux . We can then relate them to a\\nmiddle-level concept, such as Medoc.  Then we may want to generate all of the\\nregional wine classes from France, thereby generating a number of middle-level\\nconcepts.\\nFigure 2 shows a possible breakdown among the different levels of generality.\\nFigure 2. The different levels of the Wine taxonomy: Wine is the most general concept.  Red wine,\\nWhite wine,  and Rosé wine are general  top level concepts.   Pauillac  and Margaux are the\\nmost specific classes in the hierarchy (or the bottom level concepts).\\nNone of these three methods is inherently better than any of the others. The approach to\\ntake depends strongly on the personal view of the domain. If a developer has a systematic\\ntop-down view of the domain, then it may be easier to use the top-down approach. The\\ncombination approach is often the easiest for many ontology developers, since the concepts\\n“in the middle” tend to be the more descriptive concepts in the domain (Rosch 1978) .\\nIf you tend to think of wines by distinguishing the most general classification first, then the\\ntop-down approach may work better for you. If you’d rather start by getting grounded with\\nspecific examples, the bottom-up approach may be more appropriate.\\nWhichever approach we choose, we usually start by defining classes. From the list created in\\nStep 3, we select the terms that describe objects having independent existence rather than\\nterms that describe these objects.

Therefore the Pinot Noir\\nclass is a subclass of the Red Wine class.\\nFigure 2 shows a part of the class hierarchy for the Wine ontology. Section 4 contains a\\ndetailed discussion of things to look for when defining a class hierarchy.\\nFigure 3. The slots for the class Wine and the facets for these slots. The “I” icon next to the maker\\nslot indicates that the slot has an inverse (Section 5.1)\\nStep 5. Define the properties of classes—slots\\nThe classes alone will not provide enough information to answer the competency questions\\nfrom Step 1. Once we have defined some of the classes, we must describe the internal\\nstructure of concepts.\\nWe have already selected classes from the list of terms we created in Step 3. Most of the\\nremaining terms are likely to be properties of these classes. These terms include, for\\nexample, a wine’s color, body, flavor and sugar content and location  of a\\nwinery.\\nFor each property in the list, we must determine which class it describes. These properties\\nbecome slots attached to classes. Thus, the Wine class will have the following slots: color,\\nbody, flavor, and sugar. And the class Winery will have a location slot.\\nIn general, there are several types of object properties that can become slots in an ontology:\\n• “intrinsic” properties such as the flavor of a wine;\\n• “extrinsic” properties such as a wine’s name, and area it comes from;\\n• parts, if the object is structured; these can be both physical and abstract “parts” (e.g.,\\nthe courses of a meal)\\n• relationships to other individuals; these are the relationships between individual\\nmembers of the class and other items (e.g., the maker of a wine, representing a\\nrelationship between a wine and a winery, and the grape the wine is made from.)\\nThus, in addition to the properties we have identified earlier, we need to add the following\\n                                                2 We can also view classes as unary predicates—questions that have one argument.  For example, “Is this\\nobject a wine?”  Unary predicates (or classes) contrast with binary predicates (or slots)—questions that have\\ntwo arguments.  For example, “Is the flavor of this object strong?” “What is the flavor of this object?”\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

For example, all the slots of the class\\nWine will be inherited to all subclasses of Wine, including Red Wine and White Wine.\\nWe will add an additional slot, tannin level (low, moderate, or high), to the Red\\nWine class. The tannin level slot will be inherited by all the classes representing red\\nwines (such as Bordeaux  and Beaujolais ).\\nA slot should be attached at the most general class that can have that property. For instance,\\nbody and color of a wine should be attached at the class Wine, since it is the most general\\nclass whose instances will have body and color.  \\nStep 6. Define the facets of the slots\\nSlots can have different facets describing the value type, allowed values, the number of the\\nvalues (cardinality), and other features of the values the slot can take. For example, the value\\nof a name slot (as in “the name of a wine”) is one string. That is, name is a slot with value\\ntype String. A slot produces  (as in “a winery produces  these wines”) can have multiple\\nvalues and the values are instances of the class Wine. That is, produces  is a slot with value\\ntype Instance  with Wine as allowed class.\\nWe will now describe several common facets.\\nSlot cardinality\\nSlot cardinality defines how many values a slot can have. Some systems distinguish only\\nbetween single cardinality (allowing at most one value) and multiple cardinality (allowing any\\nnumber of values). A body of a wine will be a single cardinality slot (a wine can have only\\none body). Wines produced by a particular winery fill in a multiple-cardinality slot\\nproduces  for a Winery class.\\nSome systems allow specification of a minimum and maximum cardinality to describe the\\nnumber of slot values more precisely. Minimum cardinality of N means that a slot must have\\nat least N values. For example, the grape slot of a Wine has a minimum cardinality of 1:\\neach wine is made of at least one variety of grape. Maximum cardinality of M means that a\\nslot can have at most M values. The maximum cardinality for the grape slot for single\\nvarietal wines is 1: these wines are made from only one variety of grape. Sometimes it may\\nbe useful to set the maximum cardinality to 0. This setting would indicate that the slot\\ncannot have any values for a particular subclass.\\nSlot-value type\\nA value-type facet describes what types of values can fill in the slot. Here is a list of the more\\ncommon value types:\\n• String  is the simplest value type which is used for slots such as name: the value is a\\nsimple string\\n• Number  (sometimes more specific value types of Float and Integer are used)\\ndescribes slots with numeric values. For example, a price of a wine can have a value\\ntype Float\\n• Boolean  slots are simple yes–no flags. For example, if we choose not to represent\\nsparkling wines as a separate class, whether or not a wine is sparkling can be\\nrepresented as a value of a Boolean slot: if the value is “true” (“yes”) the wine is\\nsparkling and if the value is “false” (“no”) the wine is not a sparkling one.\\n• Enumerated slots specify a list of specific allowed values for the slot.

The\\nslot has cardinality multiple, value type Instance, and the class Wine as the allowed class for its\\nvalues.\\nDomain and range of a slot\\nAllowed classes for slots of type Instance are often called a range  of a slot. In the example\\nin Figure 4 the class Wine is the range of the produces  slot. Some systems allow\\nrestricting the range of a slot when the slot is attached for a particular class.\\nThe classes to which a slot is attached or a classes which property a slot describes, are called\\nthe domain  of the slot. The Winery class is the domain of the produces  slot. In the\\nsystems where we attach  slots to classes, the classes to which the slot is attached usually\\nconstitute the domain of that slot. There is no need to specify the domain separately.\\nThe basic rules for determining a domain and a range of a slot are similar:\\nWhen defining a domain or a range for a slot, find the most general classes\\nor class that can be respectively the domain or the range for the slots .\\nOn the other hand, do not define a domain and range that is overly\\ngeneral: all the classes in the domain of a slot should be described by the\\nslot and instances of all the classes in the range of a slot should be potential\\nfillers for the slot.  Do not choose an overly general class for range (i.e.,\\none would not want to make the range THING) but one would want to\\nchoose a class that will cover all fillers\\nInstead of listing all possible subclasses of the Wine class for the range of the produces\\n                                                3 Some systems just specify value type with a class instead of requiring a special statement of instance\\ntype slots.\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

At the same time, we do not want to specify the range of the slot as\\nTHING—the most general class in an ontology.\\nIn more specific terms:\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot includes a class\\nand its subclass, remove the subclass.\\nIf the range of the slot contains both the Wine class and the Red Wine class, we can\\nremove the Red Wine from the range because it does not add any new information: The\\nRed Wine is a subclass of Wine and therefore the slot range already implicitly includes it as\\nwell as all other subclasses of the Wine class.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all\\nsubclasses of a class A, but not the class A itself, the range should contain\\nonly the class A and not the subclasses.\\nInstead of defining the range of the slot to include Red Wine, White Wine, and Rose\\nWine (enumerating all the direct subclasses of Wine), we can limit the range to the class\\nWine itself.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all but a\\nfew subclasses of a class A, consider if the class A would make a more\\nappropriate range definition.\\nIn systems where attaching a slot to a class is the same as adding the class to the domain of\\nthe slot, the same rules apply to slot attachment: On the one hand, we should try to make it\\nas general as possible. On the other hand, we must ensure that each class to which we attach\\nthe slot can indeed have the property that the slot represents. We can attach the tannin\\nlevel slot to each of the classes representing red wines (e.g., Bordeaux , Merlot,\\nBeaujolais , etc.). However, since all red wines have the tannin-level property, we should\\ninstead attach the slot to this more general class of Red Wines. Generalizing the domain of\\nthe tannin level slot further (by attaching it to the Wine class instead) would not be\\ncorrect since we do not use tannin level to describe white wines for example.\\nStep 7. Create instances\\nThe last step is creating individual instances of classes in the hierarchy. Defining an individual\\ninstance of a class requires (1) choosing a class, (2) creating an individual instance of that\\nclass, and (3) filling in the slot values. For example, we can create an individual instance\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  to represent a specific type of Beaujolais wine.\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  is an instance of the class Beaujolais  representing\\nall Beaujolais wines. This instance has the following slot values defined (Figure 5):\\n• Body:  Light\\n• Color:  Red\\n• Flavor:  Delicate\\n• Tannin level: Low\\n• Grape:  Gamay (instance of the Wine grape class)\\n• Maker: Chateau-Morgon (instance of the Winery class)\\n• Region:  Beaujolais (instance of the Wine-Region  class)', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

It is a\\ndry wine.\\n4 Defining classes and a class hierarchy\\nThis section discusses things to look out for and errors that are easy to make when defining\\nclasses and a class hierarchy (Step 4 from Section 3). As we have mentioned before, there is\\nno single correct class hierarchy for any given domain. The hierarchy depends on the\\npossible uses of the ontology, the level of the detail that is necessary for the application,\\npersonal preferences, and sometimes requirements for compatibility with other models.\\nHowever, we discuss several guidelines to keep in mind when developing a class hierarchy.\\nAfter defining a considerable number of new classes, it is helpful to stand back and check if\\nthe emerging hierarchy conforms to these guidelines.\\n4.1 Ensuring that the class hierarchy is correct\\nAn “is-a” relation\\nThe class hierarchy represents an “is-a” relation: a class A is a subclass of B if every instance\\nof A is also an instance of B. For example, Chardonnay  is a subclass of White wine.\\nAnother way to think of the taxonomic relation is as a “kind-of” relation: Chardonnay  is\\na kind of White wine. A jetliner is a kind of an aircraft. Meat is a kind of food.\\nA subclass of a class represents a concept that is a “kind of” the concept\\nthat the superclass represents.\\nA single wine is not a subclass of all wines\\nA common modeling mistake is to include both a singular and a plural version of the same\\nconcept in the hierarchy making the former a subclass of the latter. For example, it is wrong\\nto define a class Wines and a class Wine as a subclass of Wines. Once you think of the\\nhierarchy as representing the “kind-of” relationship, the modeling error becomes clear: a\\nsingle Wine is not a kind of Wines. The best way to avoid such an error is always to use\\neither singular or plural in naming classes (see Section 6 for the discussion on naming\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='13concepts).\\nTransitivity of the hierarchical relations\\nA subclass relationship is transitive:\\nIf B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, then C is a subclass of A\\nFor example, we can define a class Wine, and then define a class White wine as a subclass\\nof Wine. Then we define a class Chardonnay  as a subclass of White wine. Transitivity\\nof the subclass relationship means that the class Chardonnay is also a subclass of Wine.\\nSometimes we distinguish between direct subclasses and indirect subclasses. A direct subclass\\nis the “closest” subclass of the class: there are no classes between a class and its direct subclass\\nin a hierarchy. That is, there are no other classes in the hierarchy between a class and its\\ndirect superclass. In our example, Chardonnay  is a direct subclass of White wine and is\\nnot a direct subclass of Wine.\\nEvolution of a class hierarchy\\nMaintaining a consistent class hierarchy may become challenging as domains evolve. For\\nexample, for many years, all Zinfandel wines were red. Therefore, we define a class of\\nZinfandel  wines as a subclass of the Red wine class. Sometimes, however, wine makers\\nbegan to press the grapes and to take away the color-producing aspects of the grapes\\nimmediately, thereby modifying the color of the resulting wine. Thus, we get “white\\nzinfandel” whose color is rose. Now we need to break the Zinfandel  class into two classes\\nof zinfandel— White zinfandel  and Red zinfandel —and classify them as\\nsubclasses of Rose wine and Red wine respectively.  \\nClasses and their names\\nIt is important to distinguish between a class and its name:\\nClasses represent concepts in the domain and not the words that denote\\nthese concepts.\\nThe name of a class may change if we choose a different terminology, but the term itself\\nrepresents the objective reality in the world. For example, we may create a class Shrimps,\\nand then rename it to Prawns—the class still represents the same concept. Appropriate\\nwine combinations that referred to shrimp dishes should refer to prawn dishes. In more\\npractical terms, the following rule should always be followed:\\nSynonyms for the same concept do not represent different classes\\nSynonyms are just different names for a concept or a term. Therefore, we should not have a\\nclass called Shrimp and a class called Prawn, and, possibly a class called Crevette .\\nRather, there is one class, named either Shrimp or Prawn. Many systems allow associating\\na list of synonyms, translations, or presentation names with a class. If a system does not\\nallow these associations, synonyms could always be listed in the class documentation.\\nAvoiding class cycles\\nWe should avoid cycles  in the class hierarchy. We say that there is a cycle in a hierarchy\\nwhen some class A has a subclass B and at the same time B is a superclass of A. Creating such\\na cycle in a hierarchy amounts to declaring that the classes A and B are equivalent: all\\ninstances of A are instances of B and all instances of B are also instances of A. Indeed, since\\nB is a subclass of A, all B’s instances must be instances of the class A. Since A is a subclass of\\nB, all A’s instances must also be instances of the class B.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

White wine is a more general concept than Chardonnay . Siblings should\\nrepresent concepts that fall “along the same line” in the same way that same-level sections\\nin a book are at the same level of generality. In that sense, requirements for a class hierarchy\\nare similar to the requirements for a book outline.\\nThe concepts at the root of the hierarchy however (which are often represented as direct\\nsubclasses of some very general class, such as Thing) represent major divisions of the\\ndomain and do not have to be similar concepts.\\nHow many is too many and how few are too few?\\nThere are no hard rules for the number of direct subclasses that a class should have. However,\\nmany well-structured ontologies have between two and a dozen direct subclasses. Therefore,\\nwe have the following two guidelines:\\nIf a class has only one direct subclass there may be a modeling problem or\\nthe ontology is not complete.\\nIf there are more than a dozen subclasses for a given class then additional\\nintermediate categories may be necessary.\\nThe first of the two rules is similar to a typesetting rule that bulleted lists should never have\\nonly one bullet point. For example, most of the red Burgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines.\\nSuppose we wanted to represent only this majority type of Burgundy wines. We could create a\\nclass Red Burgundy  and then a single subclass Cotes d’Or (Figure 6a). However, if in\\nour representation red Burgundy and Côtes d’Or wines are essentially equivalent (all red\\nBurgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines and all Côtes d’Or wines are red Burgundy wines),\\ncreating the Cotes d’Or class is not necessary and does not add any new information to\\nthe representation. If we were to include Côtes Chalonnaise wines, which are cheaper\\nBurgundy wines from the region just South of Côtes d’Or, then we will create two subclasses\\nof the Burgundy  class: Cotes d’Or and Cotes Chalonnaise  (Figure 6b).\\nFigure 6. Subclasses of the Red Burgundy  class.

Thus, it will inherit the value SWEET for the slot Sugar from the\\nDessert wine class and the tannin level slot and the value for its color slot from\\nthe Red wine class.\\n4.4 When to introduce a new class (or not)\\nOne of the hardest decisions to make during modeling is when to introduce a new class or\\nwhen to represent a distinction through different property values. It is hard to navigate both\\nan extremely nested hierarchy with many extraneous classes and a very flat hierarchy that\\nhas too few classes with too much information encoded in slots. Finding the appropriate\\nbalance though is not easy.\\nThere are several rules of thumb that help decide when to introduce new classes in a\\nhierarchy.\\nSubclasses of a class usually (1) have additional properties that the\\nsuperclass does not have, or (2) restrictions different from those of the\\nsuperclass, or (3) participate in different relationships than the\\nsuperclasses\\nRed wines can have different levels of tannin, whereas this property is not used to describe\\nwines in general. The value for the sugar slot of the Dessert wine is SWEET, whereas it is not\\ntrue of the superclass of the Dessert Wine class. Pinot Noir wines may go well with seafood\\nwhereas other red wines do not. In other words, we introduce a new class in the hierarchy\\nusually only when there is something that we can say about this class that we cannot say\\nabout the superclass.\\nIn practical terms, each subclass should either have new slots added to it, or have new slot\\nvalues defined, or override some facets for the inherited slots.\\nHowever, sometimes it may be useful to create new classes even if they do not introduce any\\nnew properties.\\nClasses in terminological hierarchies do not have to introduce new\\nproperties\\nFor example, some ontologies include large reference hierarchies of common terms used in\\nthe domain. For example, an ontology underlying an electronic medical-record system may\\ninclude a classification of various diseases. This classification may be just that—a hierarchy\\nof terms, without properties (or with the same set of properties). In that case, it is still useful\\nto organize the terms in a hierarchy rather than a flat list because it will (1) allow easier\\nexploration and navigation and (2) enable a doctor to choose easily a level of generality of\\nthe term that is appropriate for the situation.\\nAnother reason to introduce new classes without any new properties is to model concepts\\namong which domain experts commonly make a distinction even though we may have\\ndecided not to model the distinction itself. Since we use ontologies to facilitate\\ncommunication among domain experts and between domain experts and knowledge-based\\nsystems we would like to reflect the expert’s view of the domain in the ontology.\\nFinally, we should not create subclasses of a class for each additional restriction.  For\\nexample, we introduced the classes Red wine, White wine, and Rose wine  because\\nthis distinction is a natural one in the wine world. We did not introduce classes for delicate\\n                                                4 We chose to represent only red Ports in our ontology: white Ports do exist but they are extremely\\nuncommon.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

When defining a class hierarchy, our goal is to strike a\\nbalance between creating new classes useful for class organization and creating too many\\nclasses.\\n4.5 A new class or a property value?\\nWhen modeling a domain, we often need to decide whether to model a specific distinction\\n(such as white, red, or rosé wine) as a property value or as a set of classes again depends on\\nthe scope of the domain and the task at hand.  \\nDo we create a class White wine or do we simply create a class Wine and fill in different\\nvalues for the slot color? The answer usually lies in the scope that we defined for the\\nontology. How important the concept of White wine is in our domain? If wines have\\nonly marginal importance in the domain and whether or not the wine is white does not have\\nany particular implications for its relations to other objects, then we shouldn’t introduce a\\nseparate class for white wines. For a domain model used in a factory producing wine labels,\\nrules for wine labels of any color are the same and the distinction is not very important.\\nAlternatively, for the representation of wine, food, and their appropriate combinations a red\\nwine is very different from a white wine: it is paired with different foods, has different\\nproperties, and so on. Similarly, color of wine is important for the wines knowledge base that\\nwe may use to determine wine-tasting order.  Thus, we create a separate class for White\\nwine.\\nIf the concepts with different slot values become restrictions for different\\nslots in other classes, then we should create a new class for the distinction.\\nOtherwise, we represent the distinction in a slot value.\\nSimilarly, our wine ontology has such classes as Red Merlot and White Merlot, rather\\nthan a single class for all Merlot wines: red Merlots and white Merlots are really different\\nwines (made from the same grape) and if we are developing a detailed ontology of wine, this\\ndistinction is important.\\nIf a distinction is important in the domain and we think of the objects with\\ndifferent values for the distinction as different kinds of objects,  then we\\nshould create a new class for the distinction.\\nConsidering potential individual instances of a class may also be helpful in deciding whether\\nor not to introduce a new class.\\nA class to which an individual instance belongs should not change often.\\nUsually when we use extrinsic rather than intrinsic properties of concepts to differentiate\\namong classes, instances of those classes will have to migrate often from one class to\\nanother. For example, Chilled wine should not be a class in an ontology describing wine\\nbottles in a restaurant. The property chilled should simply be an attribute of wine in a\\nbottle since an instance of Chilled wine can easily cease being an instance of this class\\nand then become an instance of this class again.\\nUsually numbers, colors, locations are slot values and do not cause the creation of new\\nclasses. Wine, however, is a notable exception since the color of the wine is so paramount to\\nthe description of wine.\\nFor another example, consider the human-anatomy ontology. When we represent ribs, do we\\ncreate a class for each of the “1st left rib”, “2nd left rib”, and so on? Or do we have a class Rib\\nwith slots for the order and the lateral position (left-right)?5 If the information about each of\\nthe ribs that we represent in the ontology is significantly different, then we should indeed\\n                                                5 Here we assume that each anatomical organ is a class since we would also like to talk about “John’s 1st\\nleft rib.” Individual organs of existing people would be represented as individuals in our ontology.', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

If we are modeling anatomy at a slightly\\nlesser level of generality, and all ribs are very similar as far as our potential applications are\\nconcerned (we just talk about which rib is broken on the X-Ray without implications for\\nother parts of the body), we may want to simplify our hierarchy and have just the class Rib,\\nwith two slots: lateral position , order.\\n4.6 An instance or a class?\\nDeciding whether a particular concept is a class in an ontology or an individual instance\\ndepends on what the potential applications of the ontology are. Deciding where classes end\\nand individual instances begin starts with deciding what is the lowest level of granularity in the\\nrepresentation. The level of granularity is in turn determined by a potential application of\\nthe ontology. In other words, what are the most specific items that are going to be\\nrepresented in the knowledge base? Going back to the competency questions we identified in\\nStep 1 in Section 3, the most specific concepts that will constitute answers to those questionsare very good candidates for individuals in the knowledge base.\\nIndividual instances are the most specific concepts represented in a\\nknowledge base.\\nFor example, if we are only going to talk about pairing wine with food we will not be\\ninterested in the specific physical bottles of wine. Therefore, such terms as Sterling\\nVineyards Merlot are probably going to be the most specific terms we use. In other\\nwords, the Wine class is a collection not of individual bottles of wines but rather of the\\nspecific wines produced by specific wineries. Therefore, Sterling Vineyards\\nMerlot would be an instance in the knowledge base.\\nOn the other hand, if we would like to maintain an inventory of wines in the restaurant in\\naddition to the knowledge base of good wine-food pairings, individual bottles of each wine\\nmay become individual instances in our knowledge base.\\nSimilarly, if we would like to record different properties for each specific vintage of the\\nSterling Vineyards Merlot, then the specific vintage of the wine is an instance in\\na knowledge base and Sterling Vineyards Merlot is a class containing instances for\\nall its vintages.\\nAnother rule can “move” some individual instances into the set of classes:\\nIf concepts form a natural hierarchy, then we should represent them as\\nclasses\\nConsider the wine regions. Initially, we may define main wine regions, such as France, United\\nStates, Germany, and so on, as classes and specific wine regions within these large regions as\\ninstances. For example, Bourgogne region is an instance of the French region\\nclass. However, we would also like to say that the Cotes d’Or region is a\\nBourgogne region. Therefore, Bourgogne region must be a class (in order to\\nhave subclasses or instances). However, making Bourgogne region a class and Cotes\\nd’Or region an instance of Bourgogne region seems arbitrary: it is very hard to\\nclearly distinguish which regions are classes and which are instances.

However, Alsace region is a kind of a French region.\\nOnly classes can be arranged in a hierarchy—knowledge-representation systems do not have a\\nnotion of sub-instance. Therefore, if there is a natural hierarchy among terms, such as in\\nterminological hierarchies from Section 4.2, we should define these terms as classes even\\nthough they may not have any instances of their own.\\n4.7 Limiting the scope\\nAs a final note on defining a class hierarchy, the following set of rules is always helpful in\\ndeciding when an ontology definition is complete:\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible information about the\\ndomain: you do not need to specialize (or generalize) more than you need\\nfor your application (at most one extra level each way).\\nFor our wine and food example, we do not need to know what paper is used for the labels or\\nhow to cook shrimp dishes.\\nSimilarly,\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible properties of and\\ndistinctions among classes in the hierarchy.\\nIn our ontology, we certainly do not include all the properties that a wine or food could have.\\nWe represented the most salient properties of the classes of items in our ontology.  Even\\nthough wine books would tell us the size of grapes, we have not included this knowledge.\\nSimilarly, we have not added all relationships that one could imagine among all the terms in\\nour system.  For example, we do not include relationships such as favorite wine and\\nfavorite food in the ontology just to allow a more complete representation of all of\\nthe interconnections between the terms we have defined.\\nThe last rule also applies to establishing relations among concepts that we have already\\nincluded in the ontology. Consider an ontology describing biology experiments. The ontology\\nwill likely contain a concept of Biological organisms . It will also contain a concept\\nof an Experimenter  performing an experiment (with his name, affiliation, etc.).

However, we\\nprobably should not incorporate this distinction in the ontology: for the purposes of this\\nrepresentation an experimenter is not a biological organism and we will probably never\\nconduct experiments on the experimenters themselves. If we were representing everything\\nwe can say about the classes in the ontology, an Experimenter  would become a subclass\\nof Biological Organism . However, we do not need to include this knowledge for the\\nforeseeable applications. In fact, including this type of additional classification for existing\\nclasses actually hurts: now an instance of an Experimenter will have slots for weight, age,\\nspecies, and other data pertaining to a  biological organism, but absolutely irrelevant in the\\ncontext of describing an experiment. However, we should record such design decision in the\\ndocumentation for the benefit of the users who will be looking at this ontology and who may\\nnot be aware of the application we had in mind.  Otherwise, people intending to reuse the\\nontology for other applications may try to use experimenter as a subclass of person without\\nknowing that the original modeling did not include that fact.\\n4.8 Disjoint subclasses\\nMany systems allow us to specify explicitly that several classes are disjoint . Classes are\\ndisjoint if they cannot have any instances in common. For example, the Dessert wine\\nand the White wine  classes in our ontology are not disjoint: there are many wines that\\nare instances of both. The Rothermel Trochenbierenauslese Riesling\\ninstance of the Sweet Riesling  class is one such example. At the same time, the Red\\nwine and the White wine classes are disjoint: no wine can be simultaneously red and\\nwhite. Specifying that classes are disjoint enables the system to validate the ontology better.\\nIf we declare the Red wine and the White wine classes to be disjoint and later create a\\nclass that is a subclass of both Riesling  (a subclass of White wine) and Port (a\\nsubclass of Red wine), a system can indicate that there is a modeling error.\\n5 Defining properties—more details\\nIn this section we discuss several more details to keep in mind when defining slots in the\\nontology (Step 5 and Step 6 in Section 3). Mainly, we discuss inverse slots and default values\\nfor a slot.\\n5.1 Inverse slots\\nA value of a slot may depend on a value of another slot. For example, if a wine was\\nproduced by a winery, then the winery produces  that wine. These two relations,\\nmaker and produces , are called inverse relations . Storing the information “in both\\ndirections” is redundant. When we know that a wine is produced by a winery, an application\\nusing the knowledge base can always infer the value for the inverse relation that the winery\\nproduces the wine. However, from the knowledge-acquisition perspective it is convenient to\\nhave both pieces of information explicitly available. This approach allows users to fill in the\\nwine in one case and the winery in another. The knowledge-acquisition system could then\\nautomatically fill in the value for the inverse relation insuring consistency of the knowledge\\nbase.\\nOur example has a pair of inverse slots: the maker slot of the Wine class and the\\nproduces  slot of the Winery class. When a user creates an instance of the Wine class\\nand fills in the value for the maker slot, the system automatically adds the newly created\\ninstance to the produces  slot of the corresponding Winery instance. For instance, when\\nwe say that Sterling Merlot is produced by the Sterling Vineyard winery, the system would', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

The slot produces  for the class Winery is an inverse of the\\nslot  maker for the class Wine. Filling in one of the slots triggers an automatic update of the other.\\n5.2 Default values\\nMany frame-based systems allow specification of default values for slots.  If a particular slot\\nvalue is the same for most instances of a class, we can define this value to be a default  value\\nfor the slot. Then, when each new instance of a class containing this slot is created, the\\nsystem fills in the default value automatically. We can then change the value to any other\\nvalue that the facets will allow. That is, default values are there for convenience: they do not\\nenforce any new restrictions on the model or change the model in any way.\\nFor example, if the majority of wines we are going to discuss are full-bodied wines, we can\\nhave “full” as a default value for the body of the wine. Then, unless we say otherwise, all\\nwines we define would be full-bodied.\\nNote that this is different from  slot values . Slot values cannot be changed. For example, we\\ncan say that the slot sugar has value SWEET for the Dessert wine class. Then all the\\nsubclasses and instances of the Dessert wine class will have the SWEET value for the\\nslot sugar. This value cannot be changed in any of the subclasses or instances of the class.\\n6 What’s in a name?\\nDefining naming conventions for concepts in an ontology and then strictly adhering to these\\nconventions not only makes the ontology easier to understand but also helps avoid some\\ncommon modeling mistakes. There are many alternatives in naming concepts. Often there is\\nno particular reason to choose one or another alternative. However, we need to\\nDefine a naming convention for classes and slots and adhere to it.\\nThe following features of a knowledge representation system affect the choice of naming\\n', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='22conventions:\\n• Does the system have the same name space for classes, slots, and instances? That is,\\ndoes the system allow having a class and a slot with the same name (such as a class\\nwinery and a slot winery)?\\n• Is the system case-sensitive? That is, does the system treat the names that differ only\\nin case as different names (such as Winery and winery)?\\n• What delimiters does the system allow in the names? That is, can names contain\\nspaces, commas, asterisks, and so on?\\nProtégé-2000, for example, maintains a single name space for all its frames. It is case-\\nsensitive. Thus, we cannot have a class winery and a slot winery. We can, however, have\\na class Winery (note the upper-case) and a slot winery. CLASSIC, on the other hand, is\\nnot case sensitive and maintains different name spaces for classes, slots, and individuals.\\nThus, from a system perspective, there is no problem in naming both a class and a slot\\nWinery.\\n6.1 Capitalization and delimiters\\nFirst, we can greatly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent\\ncapitalization for concept names. For example, it is common to capitalize class names and\\nuse lower case for slot names (assuming the system is case-sensitive).\\nWhen a concept name contains more than one word (such as Meal course) we need to\\ndelimit the words. Here are some possible choices.\\n• Use Space: Meal course (many systems, including Protégé, allow spaces in\\nconcept names).  \\n• Run the words together and capitalize each new word: MealCourse\\n• Use an underscore or dash or other delimiter in the name: Meal_Course ,\\nMeal_course , Meal-Course , Meal-course . (If you use delimiters, you will\\nalso need to decide whether or not each new word is capitalized)\\nIf the knowledge-representation system allows spaces in names, using them may be the most\\nintuitive solution for many ontology developers. It is however, important to consider other\\nsystems with which your system may interact.  If those systems do not use spaces or if your\\npresentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method.\\n6.2 Singular or plural\\nA class name represents a collection of objects. For example, a class Wine actually\\nrepresents all wines. Therefore, it could be more natural for some designers to call the class\\nWines rather than Wine. No alternative is better or worse than the other (although singular\\nfor class names is used more often in practice). However, whatever the choice, it should be\\nconsistent throughout the whole ontology. Some systems even require their users to declare\\nin advance whether or not they are going to use singular or plural for concept names and do\\nnot allow them to stray from that choice.\\nUsing the same form all the time also prevents a designer from making such modeling\\nmistakes as creating a class Wines and then creating a class Wine as its subclass (see Section\\n4.1).\\n6.3 Prefix and suffix conventions\\nSome knowledge-base methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in the names\\nto distinguish between classes and slots.  Two common practices are to add a has- or a suffix\\n–of to slot names.  Thus, our slots become has-maker  and has-winery  if we chose the', metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\GENAI\\\\interviewcreator\\\\data\\\\ontology101.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='23has- convention. The slots become maker-of  and winery-of  if we chose the of-\\nconvention.  This approach allows anyone looking at a term to determine immediately if the\\nterm is a class or a slot.  However, the term names become slightly longer.\\n6.4 Other naming considerations\\nHere are a few more things to consider when defining naming conventions:\\n• Do not add strings such as “class”, “property”, “slot”, and so on to concept names.\\nIt is always clear form the context whether the concept is a class or a slot, for example. In\\naddition is you use different naming conventions for classes and slots (say, capitalization and\\nno capitalization respectively), the name itself would be indicative of what the concept is.\\n• It is usually a good idea to avoid abbreviations in concept names (that is, use\\nCabernet Sauvignon  rather than Cab)\\n• Names of direct subclasses of a class should either all include or not include the name\\nof the superclass. For example, if we are creating two subclasses of the Wine class to\\nrepresent red and white wines, the two subclass names should be either Red Wine\\nand White Wine or Red and White, but not Red Wine and White.\\n7 Other Resources\\nWe have used Protégé-2000 as an ontology-developing environment for our examples.\\nDuineveld and colleagues (Duineveld et al. 2000)  describe and compare a number of other\\nontology-development environments.  \\nWe have tried to address the very basics of ontology development and have not discussed\\nmany of the advanced topics or alternative methodologies for ontology development.\\nGómez-Pérez (Gómez-Pérez 1998)  and Uschold (Uschold and Gruninger 1996)  present\\nalternative ontology-development methodologies. The Ontolingua tutorial (Farquhar 1997)\\ndiscusses some formal aspects of knowledge modeling.   \\nCurrently, researchers emphasize not only ontology development, but also ontology analysis.\\nAs more ontologies are generated and reused, more tools will be available to analyze\\nontologies. For example, Chimaera (McGuinness et al. 2000)  provides diagnostic tools for\\nanalyzing ontologies. The analysis that Chimaera performs includes both a check for logical\\ncorrectness of an ontology and diagnostics of common ontology-design errors. An ontology\\ndesigner may want to run Chimaera diagnostics over the evolving ontology to determine the\\nconformance to common ontology-modeling practices.\\n8 Conclusions\\nIn this guide, we have described an ontology-development methodology for declarative\\nframe-based systems. We listed the steps in the ontology-development process and addressed\\nthe complex issues of defining class hierarchies and properties of classes and instances.\\nHowever, after following all the rules and suggestions, one of the most important things to\\nremember is the following: there is no single correct ontology for any domain . Ontology\\ndesign is a creative process and no two ontologies designed by different people would be the\\nsame. The potential applications of the ontology and the designer’s understanding and view\\nof the domain will undoubtedly affect ontology design choices. “The proof is in the\\npudding”—we can assess the quality of our ontology only by using it in applications for which\\nwe designed it.

McGuinness\\nStanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305\\nnoy@smi.stanford.edu   and    dlm@ksl.stanford.edu\\n1 Why develop an ontology?\\nIn recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in\\nthe domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of\\nArtificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have\\nbecome common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large\\ntaxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for\\nsale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is\\ndeveloping the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for\\nencoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching\\nfor information.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in\\nconjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by\\nextending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the\\nWeb (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies\\nthat domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for\\nexample, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED  (Price and\\nSpackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System\\n(Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For\\nexample, the United Nations Development Program and Dun & Bradstreet combined their\\nefforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and\\nservices (www.unspsc.org).\\nAn ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in\\na domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and\\nrelations among them.\\nWhy would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:\\n• To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or\\nsoftware agents\\n• To enable reuse of domain knowledge\\n• To make domain assumptions explicit\\n• To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge\\n• To analyze domain knowledge\\nSharing common understanding of the structure of information among people or software\\nagents  is one of the more common goals in developing ontologies (Musen 1992; Gruber\\n1993). For example, suppose several different Web sites contain medical information or\\nprovide medical e-commerce services. If these Web sites share and publish the same\\nunderlying ontology of the terms they all use, then computer agents can extract and\\naggregate information from these different sites. The agents can use this aggregated\\ninformation to answer user queries or as input data to other applications.\\nEnabling reuse of domain knowledge  was one of the driving forces behind recent surge in\\nontology research. For example, models for many different domains need to represent the\\nnotion of time. This representation includes the notions of time intervals, points in time,\\nrelative measures of time, and so on. If one group of researchers develops such an ontology\\nin detail, others can simply reuse it for their domains. Additionally, if we need to build a large2ontology, we can integrate several existing ontologies describing portions of the large\\ndomain. We can also reuse a general ontology, such as the UNSPSC ontology, and extend it\\nto describe our domain of interest.\\nMaking explicit domain assumptions underlying an implementation makes it possible to\\nchange these assumptions easily if our knowledge about the domain changes. Hard-coding\\nassumptions about the world in programming-language code makes these assumptions not\\nonly hard to find and understand but also hard to change, in particular for someone without\\nprogramming expertise. In addition, explicit specifications of domain knowledge are useful\\nfor new users who must learn what terms in the domain mean.  \\nSeparating the domain knowledge from the operational knowledge is another common use\\nof ontologies. We can describe a task of configuring a product from its components according\\nto a required specification and implement a program that does this configuration independent\\nof the products and components themselves (McGuinness and Wright 1998). We can then\\ndevelop an ontology of PC-components and characteristics and apply the algorithm to\\nconfigure made-to-order PCs. We can also use the same algorithm to configure elevators if\\nwe “feed” an elevator component ontology to it (Rothenfluh et al. 1996).\\nAnalyzing domain knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is\\navailable.  Formal analysis of terms is extremely valuable when both attempting to reuse\\nexisting ontologies and extending them (McGuinness et al. 2000).\\nOften an ontology of the domain is not a goal in itself. Developing an ontology is akin to\\ndefining a set of data and their structure for other programs to use. Problem-solving methods,\\ndomain-independent applications, and software agents use ontologies and knowledge bases\\nbuilt from ontologies as data. For example, in this paper we develop an ontology of wine and\\nfood and appropriate combinations of wine with meals. This ontology can then be used as a\\nbasis for some applications in a suite of restaurant-managing tools: One application could\\ncreate wine suggestions for the menu of the day or answer queries of waiters and customers.\\nAnother application could analyze an inventory list of a wine cellar and suggest which wine\\ncategories to expand and which particular wines to purchase for upcoming menus or\\ncookbooks.\\nAbout this guide\\nWe build on our experience using Protégé-2000 (Protege 2000) , Ontolingua (Ontolingua\\n1997) , and Chimaera (Chimaera 2000)  as ontology-editing environments. In this guide, we\\nuse Protégé-2000 for our examples.\\nThe wine and food example that we use throughout this guide is loosely based on an example\\nknowledge base presented in a paper describing CLASSIC—a knowledge-representation\\nsystem based on a description-logics approach (Brachman et al. 1991) . The CLASSIC tutorial\\n(McGuinness et al. 1994)  has developed this example further. Protégé-2000 and other\\nframe-based systems describe ontologies declaratively, stating explicitly what the class\\nhierarchy is and to which classes individuals belong.\\nSome ontology-design ideas in this guide originated from the literature on object-oriented\\ndesign (Rumbaugh et al. 1991; Booch et al. 1997). However, ontology development is\\ndifferent from designing classes and relations in object-oriented programming. Object-\\noriented programming centers primarily around methods on classes—a programmer makes\\ndesign decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontology designer\\nmakes these decisions based on the structural  properties of a class. As a result, a class\\nstructure and relations among classes in an ontology are different from the structure for a\\nsimilar domain in an object-oriented program.\\nIt is impossible to cover all the issues that an ontology developer may need to grapple with\\nand we are not trying to address all of them in this guide. Instead, we try to provide a starting\\npoint; an initial guide that would help a new ontology designer to develop ontologies. At the3end, we suggest places to look for explanations of more complicated structures and design\\nmechanisms if the domain requires them.\\nFinally, there is no single correct ontology-design methodology and we did not attempt to\\ndefine one. The ideas that we present here are the ones that we found useful in our own\\nontology-development experience. At the end of this guide we suggest a list of references for\\nalternative methodologies.\\n2 What is in an ontology?\\nThe Artificial-Intelligence literature contains many definitions of an ontology; many of\\nthese contradict one another. For the purposes of this guide an ontology  is a formal explicit\\ndescription of concepts in a domain of discourse (classes (sometimes called concepts )),\\nproperties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept (slots\\n(sometimes called  roles or properties )), and restrictions on slots (facets (sometimes called\\nrole restrictions )). An ontology together with a set of individual instances  of classes\\nconstitutes a knowledge base . In reality, there is a fine line where the ontology ends and\\nthe knowledge base begins.\\nClasses are the focus of most ontologies. Classes describe concepts in the domain. For\\nexample, a class of wines represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class. The\\nBordeaux wine in the glass in front of you while you read this document is an instance of the\\nclass of Bordeaux wines. A class can have subclasses  that represent concepts that are more\\nspecific than the superclass. For example, we can divide the class of all wines into red, white,\\nand rosé wines. Alternatively, we can divide a class of all wines into sparkling and non-\\nsparkling wines.  \\nSlots  describe properties of classes and instances: Château Lafite Rothschild\\nPauillac  wine has a full body; it is produced by the Château Lafite Rothschild\\nwinery. We have two slots describing the wine in this example: the slot body with the value\\nfull and the slot maker with the value Château Lafite Rothschild  winery. At the\\nclass level, we can say that instances of the class Wine will have slots describing their\\nflavor, body, sugar level, the maker of the wine and so on.1\\nAll instances of the class Wine, and its subclass Pauillac, have a slot maker the value of\\nwhich is an instance of the class Winery (Figure 1). All instances of the class Winery have a\\nslot produces  that refers to all the wines (instances of the class Wine and its subclasses)\\nthat the winery produces.\\nIn practical terms, developing an ontology includes:\\n• defining classes in the ontology,\\n• arranging the classes in a taxonomic (subclass–superclass) hierarchy,\\n• defining slots and describing allowed values for these slots,\\n• filling in the values for slots for instances.\\nWe can then create a knowledge base by defining individual instances of these classes filling in\\nspecific slot value information and additional slot restrictions.\\n                                                1 We capitalize class names and start slot names with low-case letters. We also use typewriter font  for\\nall terms from the example ontology.4Figure 1.  Some classes, instances, and relations among them in the wine domain.  We used black\\nfor classes and red for instances. Direct links represent slots and internal links such as instance-of\\nand subclass-of.\\n3 A Simple Knowledge-Engineering Methodology\\nAs we said earlier, there is no one “correct” way or methodology for developing ontologies.\\nHere we discuss general issues to consider and offer one possible process for developing an\\nontology. We describe an iterative approach to ontology development: we start with a rough\\nfirst pass at the ontology. We then revise and refine the evolving ontology and fill in the\\ndetails. Along the way, we discuss the modeling decisions that a designer needs to make, as\\nwell as the pros, cons, and implications of different solutions.\\nFirst, we would like to emphasize some fundamental rules in ontology design to which we will\\nrefer many times. These rules may seem rather dogmatic. They can help, however, to make\\ndesign decisions in many cases.\\n1) There is no one correct way to model a domain— there are always\\nviable alternatives. The best solution almost always depends on the\\napplication that you have in mind and the extensions that you anticipate.\\n2) Ontology development is necessarily an iterative process.\\n3) Concepts in the ontology should be close to objects (physical or logical)\\nand relationships in your domain of interest. These are most likely to be\\nnouns (objects) or verbs (relationships) in sentences that describe your\\ndomain.\\nThat is, deciding what we are going to use the ontology for, and how detailed or general the\\nontology is going to be will guide many of the modeling decisions down the road. Among\\nseveral viable alternatives, we will need to determine which one would work better for the\\nprojected task, be more intuitive, more extensible, and more maintainable. We also need to\\nremember that an ontology is a model of reality of the world and the concepts in the\\nontology must reflect this reality. After we define an initial version of the ontology, we can\\nevaluate and debug it by using it in applications or problem-solving methods or by discussing\\nit with experts in the field, or both. As a result, we will almost certainly need to revise the\\ninitial ontology. This process of iterative design will likely continue through the entire\\nlifecycle of the ontology.\\n5Step 1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology\\nWe suggest starting the development of an ontology by defining its domain and scope. That\\nis, answer several basic questions:\\n• What is the domain that the ontology will cover?\\n• For what we are going to use the ontology?\\n• For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?\\n• Who will use and maintain the ontology?\\nThe answers to these questions may change during the ontology-design process, but at any\\ngiven time they help limit the scope of the model.\\nConsider the ontology of wine and food that we introduced earlier. Representation of food\\nand wines is the domain of the ontology. We plan to use this ontology for the applications\\nthat suggest good combinations of wines and food.\\nNaturally, the concepts describing different types of wines, main food types, the notion of a\\ngood combination of wine and food and a bad combination will figure into our ontology. At\\nthe same time, it is unlikely that the ontology will include concepts for managing inventory\\nin a winery or employees in a restaurant even though these concepts are somewhat related to\\nthe notions of wine and food.\\nIf the ontology we are designing will be used to assist in natural language processing of articles\\nin wine magazines, it may be important to include synonyms and part-of-speech information\\nfor concepts in the ontology. If the ontology will be used to help restaurant customers decide\\nwhich wine to order, we need to include retail-pricing information.  If it is used for wine\\nbuyers in stocking a wine cellar, wholesale pricing and availability may be necessary.  If the\\npeople who will maintain the ontology describe the domain in a language that is different\\nfrom the language of the ontology users, we may need to provide the mapping between the\\nlanguages.\\nCompetency questions.\\nOne of the ways to determine the scope of the ontology is to sketch a list of questions that a\\nknowledge base based on the ontology should be able to answer, competency questions\\n(Gruninger and Fox 1995) . These questions will serve as the litmus test later: Does the\\nontology contain enough information to answer these types of questions? Do the answers\\nrequire a particular level of detail or representation of a particular area? These competency\\nquestions are just a sketch and do not need to be exhaustive.\\nIn the wine and food domain, the following are the possible competency questions:\\n• Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?\\n• Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?\\n• Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?\\n• What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?\\n• Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?\\n• Does a bouquet or body of a specific wine change with vintage year?\\n• What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?\\nJudging from this list of questions, the ontology will include the information on various wine\\ncharacteristics and wine types, vintage years—good and bad ones—classifications of foods\\nthat matter for choosing an appropriate wine, recommended combinations of wine and food.\\nStep 2. Consider reusing existing ontologies\\nIt is almost always worth considering what someone else has done and checking if we can\\nrefine and extend existing sources for our particular domain and task. Reusing existing6ontologies may be a requirement if our system needs to interact with other applications that\\nhave already committed to particular ontologies or controlled vocabularies.  Many ontologies\\nare already available in electronic form and can be imported into an ontology-development\\nenvironment that you are using. The formalism in which an ontology is expressed often does\\nnot matter, since many knowledge-representation systems can import and export ontologies.\\nEven if a knowledge-representation system cannot work directly with a particular formalism,\\nthe task of translating an ontology from one formalism to another is usually not a difficult\\none.\\nThere are libraries of reusable ontologies on the Web and in the literature. For example, we\\ncan use the Ontolingua ontology library (http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/software/ontolingua/) orthe DAML ontology library (http://www.daml.org/ontologies/).  There are also a number ofpublicly available commercial ontologies (e.g., UNSPSC (www.unspsc.org), RosettaNet\\n(www.rosettanet.org), DMOZ (www.dmoz.org)).\\nFor example, a knowledge base of French wines may already exist. If we can import this\\nknowledge base and the ontology on which it is based, we will have not only the classification\\nof French wines but also the first pass at the classification of wine characteristics used to\\ndistinguish and describe the wines. Lists of wine properties may already be available from\\ncommercial Web sites such as www.wines.com that customers consider use to buy wines.For this guide however we will assume that no relevant ontologies already exist and start\\ndeveloping the ontology from scratch.\\nStep 3. Enumerate important terms in the ontology\\nIt is useful to write down a list of all terms we would like either to make statements about or\\nto explain to a user. What are the terms we would like to talk about? What properties do\\nthose terms have? What would we like to say about those terms? For example, important\\nwine-related terms will include wine, grape, winery, location , a wine’s color,\\nbody, flavor and sugar content; different types of food, such as fish and red\\nmeat; subtypes of wine such as white wine, and so on. Initially, it is important to get a\\ncomprehensive list of terms without worrying about overlap between concepts they\\nrepresent, relations among the terms, or any properties that the concepts may have, or\\nwhether the concepts are classes or slots.\\nThe next two steps—developing the class hierarchy and defining properties of concepts\\n(slots)—are closely intertwined. It is hard to do one of them first and then do the other.\\nTypically, we create a few definitions of the concepts in the hierarchy and then continue by\\ndescribing properties of these concepts and so on. These two steps are also the most\\nimportant steps in the ontology-design process. We will describe them here briefly and then\\nspend the next two sections discussing the more complicated issues that need to be\\nconsidered, common pitfalls, decisions to make, and so on.\\nStep 4. Define the classes and the class hierarchy\\nThere are several possible approaches in developing a class hierarchy (Uschold and\\nGruninger 1996) :\\n• A top-down  development process starts with the definition of the most general\\nconcepts in the domain and subsequent specialization of the concepts. For example,\\nwe can start with creating classes for the general concepts of Wine and Food. Then\\nwe specialize the Wine class by creating some of its subclasses: White wine, Red\\nwine, Rosé wine. We can further categorize the Red wine class, for example,\\ninto Syrah, Red Burgundy , Cabernet Sauvignon , and so on.7• A bottom-up  development process starts with the definition of the most specific\\nclasses, the leaves of the hierarchy, with subsequent grouping of these classes into\\nmore general concepts. For example, we start by defining classes for Pauillac  and\\nMargaux wines. We then create a common superclass for these two\\nclasses— Medoc—which in turn is a subclass of Bordeaux .\\n• A combination  development process is a combination of the top-down and bottom-\\nup approaches: We define the more salient concepts first and then generalize and\\nspecialize them appropriately. We might start with a few top-level concepts such as\\nWine, and a few specific concepts, such as Margaux . We can then relate them to a\\nmiddle-level concept, such as Medoc.  Then we may want to generate all of the\\nregional wine classes from France, thereby generating a number of middle-level\\nconcepts.\\nFigure 2 shows a possible breakdown among the different levels of generality.\\nFigure 2. The different levels of the Wine taxonomy: Wine is the most general concept.  Red wine,\\nWhite wine,  and Rosé wine are general  top level concepts.   Pauillac  and Margaux are the\\nmost specific classes in the hierarchy (or the bottom level concepts).\\nNone of these three methods is inherently better than any of the others. The approach to\\ntake depends strongly on the personal view of the domain. If a developer has a systematic\\ntop-down view of the domain, then it may be easier to use the top-down approach. The\\ncombination approach is often the easiest for many ontology developers, since the concepts\\n“in the middle” tend to be the more descriptive concepts in the domain (Rosch 1978) .\\nIf you tend to think of wines by distinguishing the most general classification first, then the\\ntop-down approach may work better for you. If you’d rather start by getting grounded with\\nspecific examples, the bottom-up approach may be more appropriate.\\nWhichever approach we choose, we usually start by defining classes. From the list created in\\nStep 3, we select the terms that describe objects having independent existence rather than\\nterms that describe these objects. These terms will be classes in the ontology and will become8anchors in the class hierarchy.2 We organize the classes into a hierarchical taxonomy by\\nasking if by being an instance of one class, the object will necessarily (i.e., by definition) be\\nan instance of some other class.\\nIf a class A is a superclass of class B, then every instance of B is also an\\ninstance of A\\nIn other words, the class B represents a concept that is a “kind of” A.\\nFor example, every Pinot Noir wine is necessarily a red wine. Therefore the Pinot Noir\\nclass is a subclass of the Red Wine class.\\nFigure 2 shows a part of the class hierarchy for the Wine ontology. Section 4 contains a\\ndetailed discussion of things to look for when defining a class hierarchy.\\nFigure 3. The slots for the class Wine and the facets for these slots. The “I” icon next to the maker\\nslot indicates that the slot has an inverse (Section 5.1)\\nStep 5. Define the properties of classes—slots\\nThe classes alone will not provide enough information to answer the competency questions\\nfrom Step 1. Once we have defined some of the classes, we must describe the internal\\nstructure of concepts.\\nWe have already selected classes from the list of terms we created in Step 3. Most of the\\nremaining terms are likely to be properties of these classes. These terms include, for\\nexample, a wine’s color, body, flavor and sugar content and location  of a\\nwinery.\\nFor each property in the list, we must determine which class it describes. These properties\\nbecome slots attached to classes. Thus, the Wine class will have the following slots: color,\\nbody, flavor, and sugar. And the class Winery will have a location slot.\\nIn general, there are several types of object properties that can become slots in an ontology:\\n• “intrinsic” properties such as the flavor of a wine;\\n• “extrinsic” properties such as a wine’s name, and area it comes from;\\n• parts, if the object is structured; these can be both physical and abstract “parts” (e.g.,\\nthe courses of a meal)\\n• relationships to other individuals; these are the relationships between individual\\nmembers of the class and other items (e.g., the maker of a wine, representing a\\nrelationship between a wine and a winery, and the grape the wine is made from.)\\nThus, in addition to the properties we have identified earlier, we need to add the following\\n                                                2 We can also view classes as unary predicates—questions that have one argument.  For example, “Is this\\nobject a wine?”  Unary predicates (or classes) contrast with binary predicates (or slots)—questions that have\\ntwo arguments.  For example, “Is the flavor of this object strong?” “What is the flavor of this object?”\\n9slots to the Wine class: name, area, maker, grape. Figure 3 shows the slots for the class\\nWine.\\nAll subclasses of a class inherit  the slot of that class. For example, all the slots of the class\\nWine will be inherited to all subclasses of Wine, including Red Wine and White Wine.\\nWe will add an additional slot, tannin level (low, moderate, or high), to the Red\\nWine class. The tannin level slot will be inherited by all the classes representing red\\nwines (such as Bordeaux  and Beaujolais ).\\nA slot should be attached at the most general class that can have that property. For instance,\\nbody and color of a wine should be attached at the class Wine, since it is the most general\\nclass whose instances will have body and color.  \\nStep 6. Define the facets of the slots\\nSlots can have different facets describing the value type, allowed values, the number of the\\nvalues (cardinality), and other features of the values the slot can take. For example, the value\\nof a name slot (as in “the name of a wine”) is one string. That is, name is a slot with value\\ntype String. A slot produces  (as in “a winery produces  these wines”) can have multiple\\nvalues and the values are instances of the class Wine. That is, produces  is a slot with value\\ntype Instance  with Wine as allowed class.\\nWe will now describe several common facets.\\nSlot cardinality\\nSlot cardinality defines how many values a slot can have. Some systems distinguish only\\nbetween single cardinality (allowing at most one value) and multiple cardinality (allowing any\\nnumber of values). A body of a wine will be a single cardinality slot (a wine can have only\\none body). Wines produced by a particular winery fill in a multiple-cardinality slot\\nproduces  for a Winery class.\\nSome systems allow specification of a minimum and maximum cardinality to describe the\\nnumber of slot values more precisely. Minimum cardinality of N means that a slot must have\\nat least N values. For example, the grape slot of a Wine has a minimum cardinality of 1:\\neach wine is made of at least one variety of grape. Maximum cardinality of M means that a\\nslot can have at most M values. The maximum cardinality for the grape slot for single\\nvarietal wines is 1: these wines are made from only one variety of grape. Sometimes it may\\nbe useful to set the maximum cardinality to 0. This setting would indicate that the slot\\ncannot have any values for a particular subclass.\\nSlot-value type\\nA value-type facet describes what types of values can fill in the slot. Here is a list of the more\\ncommon value types:\\n• String  is the simplest value type which is used for slots such as name: the value is a\\nsimple string\\n• Number  (sometimes more specific value types of Float and Integer are used)\\ndescribes slots with numeric values. For example, a price of a wine can have a value\\ntype Float\\n• Boolean  slots are simple yes–no flags. For example, if we choose not to represent\\nsparkling wines as a separate class, whether or not a wine is sparkling can be\\nrepresented as a value of a Boolean slot: if the value is “true” (“yes”) the wine is\\nsparkling and if the value is “false” (“no”) the wine is not a sparkling one.\\n• Enumerated slots specify a list of specific allowed values for the slot. For example,\\nwe can specify that the flavor slot can take on one of the three possible values:10strong, moderate , and delicate . In Protégé-2000 the enumerated slots are of\\ntype Symbol.\\n• Instance -type slots allow definition of relationships between individuals. Slots with\\nvalue type Instance must also define a list of allowed classes from which the instances\\ncan come. For example, a slot produces  for the class Winery may have instances\\nof the class Wine as its values.3\\nFigure 4 shows a definition of the slot produces  at the class Winery.\\nFigure 4. The definition of a slot produces  that describes the wines produced by a winery. The\\nslot has cardinality multiple, value type Instance, and the class Wine as the allowed class for its\\nvalues.\\nDomain and range of a slot\\nAllowed classes for slots of type Instance are often called a range  of a slot. In the example\\nin Figure 4 the class Wine is the range of the produces  slot. Some systems allow\\nrestricting the range of a slot when the slot is attached for a particular class.\\nThe classes to which a slot is attached or a classes which property a slot describes, are called\\nthe domain  of the slot. The Winery class is the domain of the produces  slot. In the\\nsystems where we attach  slots to classes, the classes to which the slot is attached usually\\nconstitute the domain of that slot. There is no need to specify the domain separately.\\nThe basic rules for determining a domain and a range of a slot are similar:\\nWhen defining a domain or a range for a slot, find the most general classes\\nor class that can be respectively the domain or the range for the slots .\\nOn the other hand, do not define a domain and range that is overly\\ngeneral: all the classes in the domain of a slot should be described by the\\nslot and instances of all the classes in the range of a slot should be potential\\nfillers for the slot.  Do not choose an overly general class for range (i.e.,\\none would not want to make the range THING) but one would want to\\nchoose a class that will cover all fillers\\nInstead of listing all possible subclasses of the Wine class for the range of the produces\\n                                                3 Some systems just specify value type with a class instead of requiring a special statement of instance\\ntype slots.\\n11slot, just list Wine. At the same time, we do not want to specify the range of the slot as\\nTHING—the most general class in an ontology.\\nIn more specific terms:\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot includes a class\\nand its subclass, remove the subclass.\\nIf the range of the slot contains both the Wine class and the Red Wine class, we can\\nremove the Red Wine from the range because it does not add any new information: The\\nRed Wine is a subclass of Wine and therefore the slot range already implicitly includes it as\\nwell as all other subclasses of the Wine class.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all\\nsubclasses of a class A, but not the class A itself, the range should contain\\nonly the class A and not the subclasses.\\nInstead of defining the range of the slot to include Red Wine, White Wine, and Rose\\nWine (enumerating all the direct subclasses of Wine), we can limit the range to the class\\nWine itself.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all but a\\nfew subclasses of a class A, consider if the class A would make a more\\nappropriate range definition.\\nIn systems where attaching a slot to a class is the same as adding the class to the domain of\\nthe slot, the same rules apply to slot attachment: On the one hand, we should try to make it\\nas general as possible. On the other hand, we must ensure that each class to which we attach\\nthe slot can indeed have the property that the slot represents. We can attach the tannin\\nlevel slot to each of the classes representing red wines (e.g., Bordeaux , Merlot,\\nBeaujolais , etc.). However, since all red wines have the tannin-level property, we should\\ninstead attach the slot to this more general class of Red Wines. Generalizing the domain of\\nthe tannin level slot further (by attaching it to the Wine class instead) would not be\\ncorrect since we do not use tannin level to describe white wines for example.\\nStep 7. Create instances\\nThe last step is creating individual instances of classes in the hierarchy. Defining an individual\\ninstance of a class requires (1) choosing a class, (2) creating an individual instance of that\\nclass, and (3) filling in the slot values. For example, we can create an individual instance\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  to represent a specific type of Beaujolais wine.\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  is an instance of the class Beaujolais  representing\\nall Beaujolais wines. This instance has the following slot values defined (Figure 5):\\n• Body:  Light\\n• Color:  Red\\n• Flavor:  Delicate\\n• Tannin level: Low\\n• Grape:  Gamay (instance of the Wine grape class)\\n• Maker: Chateau-Morgon (instance of the Winery class)\\n• Region:  Beaujolais (instance of the Wine-Region  class)12• Sugar:  Dry\\nFigure 5. The definition of an instance of the Beaujolais  class. The instance is Chateaux\\nMorgon Beaujolais  from the Beaujolais region, produced from the Gamay grape by the\\nChateau Morgon winery. It has a light body, delicate flavor, red color, and low tannin level. It is a\\ndry wine.\\n4 Defining classes and a class hierarchy\\nThis section discusses things to look out for and errors that are easy to make when defining\\nclasses and a class hierarchy (Step 4 from Section 3). As we have mentioned before, there is\\nno single correct class hierarchy for any given domain. The hierarchy depends on the\\npossible uses of the ontology, the level of the detail that is necessary for the application,\\npersonal preferences, and sometimes requirements for compatibility with other models.\\nHowever, we discuss several guidelines to keep in mind when developing a class hierarchy.\\nAfter defining a considerable number of new classes, it is helpful to stand back and check if\\nthe emerging hierarchy conforms to these guidelines.\\n4.1 Ensuring that the class hierarchy is correct\\nAn “is-a” relation\\nThe class hierarchy represents an “is-a” relation: a class A is a subclass of B if every instance\\nof A is also an instance of B. For example, Chardonnay  is a subclass of White wine.\\nAnother way to think of the taxonomic relation is as a “kind-of” relation: Chardonnay  is\\na kind of White wine. A jetliner is a kind of an aircraft. Meat is a kind of food.\\nA subclass of a class represents a concept that is a “kind of” the concept\\nthat the superclass represents.\\nA single wine is not a subclass of all wines\\nA common modeling mistake is to include both a singular and a plural version of the same\\nconcept in the hierarchy making the former a subclass of the latter. For example, it is wrong\\nto define a class Wines and a class Wine as a subclass of Wines. Once you think of the\\nhierarchy as representing the “kind-of” relationship, the modeling error becomes clear: a\\nsingle Wine is not a kind of Wines. The best way to avoid such an error is always to use\\neither singular or plural in naming classes (see Section 6 for the discussion on naming\\n13concepts).\\nTransitivity of the hierarchical relations\\nA subclass relationship is transitive:\\nIf B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, then C is a subclass of A\\nFor example, we can define a class Wine, and then define a class White wine as a subclass\\nof Wine. Then we define a class Chardonnay  as a subclass of White wine. Transitivity\\nof the subclass relationship means that the class Chardonnay is also a subclass of Wine.\\nSometimes we distinguish between direct subclasses and indirect subclasses. A direct subclass\\nis the “closest” subclass of the class: there are no classes between a class and its direct subclass\\nin a hierarchy. That is, there are no other classes in the hierarchy between a class and its\\ndirect superclass. In our example, Chardonnay  is a direct subclass of White wine and is\\nnot a direct subclass of Wine.\\nEvolution of a class hierarchy\\nMaintaining a consistent class hierarchy may become challenging as domains evolve. For\\nexample, for many years, all Zinfandel wines were red. Therefore, we define a class of\\nZinfandel  wines as a subclass of the Red wine class. Sometimes, however, wine makers\\nbegan to press the grapes and to take away the color-producing aspects of the grapes\\nimmediately, thereby modifying the color of the resulting wine. Thus, we get “white\\nzinfandel” whose color is rose. Now we need to break the Zinfandel  class into two classes\\nof zinfandel— White zinfandel  and Red zinfandel —and classify them as\\nsubclasses of Rose wine and Red wine respectively.  \\nClasses and their names\\nIt is important to distinguish between a class and its name:\\nClasses represent concepts in the domain and not the words that denote\\nthese concepts.\\nThe name of a class may change if we choose a different terminology, but the term itself\\nrepresents the objective reality in the world. For example, we may create a class Shrimps,\\nand then rename it to Prawns—the class still represents the same concept. Appropriate\\nwine combinations that referred to shrimp dishes should refer to prawn dishes. In more\\npractical terms, the following rule should always be followed:\\nSynonyms for the same concept do not represent different classes\\nSynonyms are just different names for a concept or a term. Therefore, we should not have a\\nclass called Shrimp and a class called Prawn, and, possibly a class called Crevette .\\nRather, there is one class, named either Shrimp or Prawn. Many systems allow associating\\na list of synonyms, translations, or presentation names with a class. If a system does not\\nallow these associations, synonyms could always be listed in the class documentation.\\nAvoiding class cycles\\nWe should avoid cycles  in the class hierarchy. We say that there is a cycle in a hierarchy\\nwhen some class A has a subclass B and at the same time B is a superclass of A. Creating such\\na cycle in a hierarchy amounts to declaring that the classes A and B are equivalent: all\\ninstances of A are instances of B and all instances of B are also instances of A. Indeed, since\\nB is a subclass of A, all B’s instances must be instances of the class A. Since A is a subclass of\\nB, all A’s instances must also be instances of the class B.144.2 Analyzing siblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings  in the hierarchy are classes that are direct subclasses of the same class (see Section\\n4.1).\\nAll the siblings in the hierarchy (except for the ones at the root) must be at\\nthe same level of generality.\\nFor example, White wine and Chardonnay  should not be subclasses of the same class\\n(say, Wine). White wine is a more general concept than Chardonnay . Siblings should\\nrepresent concepts that fall “along the same line” in the same way that same-level sections\\nin a book are at the same level of generality. In that sense, requirements for a class hierarchy\\nare similar to the requirements for a book outline.\\nThe concepts at the root of the hierarchy however (which are often represented as direct\\nsubclasses of some very general class, such as Thing) represent major divisions of the\\ndomain and do not have to be similar concepts.\\nHow many is too many and how few are too few?\\nThere are no hard rules for the number of direct subclasses that a class should have. However,\\nmany well-structured ontologies have between two and a dozen direct subclasses. Therefore,\\nwe have the following two guidelines:\\nIf a class has only one direct subclass there may be a modeling problem or\\nthe ontology is not complete.\\nIf there are more than a dozen subclasses for a given class then additional\\nintermediate categories may be necessary.\\nThe first of the two rules is similar to a typesetting rule that bulleted lists should never have\\nonly one bullet point. For example, most of the red Burgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines.\\nSuppose we wanted to represent only this majority type of Burgundy wines. We could create a\\nclass Red Burgundy  and then a single subclass Cotes d’Or (Figure 6a). However, if in\\nour representation red Burgundy and Côtes d’Or wines are essentially equivalent (all red\\nBurgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines and all Côtes d’Or wines are red Burgundy wines),\\ncreating the Cotes d’Or class is not necessary and does not add any new information to\\nthe representation. If we were to include Côtes Chalonnaise wines, which are cheaper\\nBurgundy wines from the region just South of Côtes d’Or, then we will create two subclasses\\nof the Burgundy  class: Cotes d’Or and Cotes Chalonnaise  (Figure 6b).\\nFigure 6. Subclasses of the Red Burgundy  class. Having a single subclass of a class usually\\npoints to a problem in modeling.\\nSuppose now that we list all types of wines as direct subclasses of the Wine class. This list\\nwould then include such more general types of wine as Beaujolais and Bordeaux, as well as\\nmore specific types such as Paulliac and Margaux (Figure 6a). The class Wine has too many\\ndirect subclasses and, indeed, for the ontology to reflect the different types of wine in a more\\norganized manner, Medoc should be a subclass of Bordeaux  and Cotes d’Or should be a\\n15subclass of Burgundy . Also having such intermediate categories as Red wine and White\\nwine would also reflect the conceptual model of the domain of wines that many people have\\n(Figure 6b).\\nHowever, if no natural classes exist to group concepts in the long list of siblings, there is no\\nneed to create artificial classes—just leave the classes the way they are. After all, the\\nontology is a reflection of the real world, and if no categorization exists in the real world,\\nthen the ontology should reflect that.\\nFigure 7. Categorizing wines. Having all the wines and types of wine versus having several levels of\\ncategorization.\\n4.3 Multiple inheritance\\nMost knowledge-representation systems allow multiple inheritance  in the class hierarchy:\\na class can be a subclass of several classes. Suppose we would like to create a separate class of\\ndessert wines, the Dessert wine class. The Port wine is both a red wine and a dessert\\n16wine.4 Therefore, we define a class Port to have two superclasses: Red wine and\\nDessert wine. All instances of the Port class will be instances of both the Red wine\\nclass and the Dessert wine class. The Port class will inherit its slots and their facets\\nfrom both its parents. Thus, it will inherit the value SWEET for the slot Sugar from the\\nDessert wine class and the tannin level slot and the value for its color slot from\\nthe Red wine class.\\n4.4 When to introduce a new class (or not)\\nOne of the hardest decisions to make during modeling is when to introduce a new class or\\nwhen to represent a distinction through different property values. It is hard to navigate both\\nan extremely nested hierarchy with many extraneous classes and a very flat hierarchy that\\nhas too few classes with too much information encoded in slots. Finding the appropriate\\nbalance though is not easy.\\nThere are several rules of thumb that help decide when to introduce new classes in a\\nhierarchy.\\nSubclasses of a class usually (1) have additional properties that the\\nsuperclass does not have, or (2) restrictions different from those of the\\nsuperclass, or (3) participate in different relationships than the\\nsuperclasses\\nRed wines can have different levels of tannin, whereas this property is not used to describe\\nwines in general. The value for the sugar slot of the Dessert wine is SWEET, whereas it is not\\ntrue of the superclass of the Dessert Wine class. Pinot Noir wines may go well with seafood\\nwhereas other red wines do not. In other words, we introduce a new class in the hierarchy\\nusually only when there is something that we can say about this class that we cannot say\\nabout the superclass.\\nIn practical terms, each subclass should either have new slots added to it, or have new slot\\nvalues defined, or override some facets for the inherited slots.\\nHowever, sometimes it may be useful to create new classes even if they do not introduce any\\nnew properties.\\nClasses in terminological hierarchies do not have to introduce new\\nproperties\\nFor example, some ontologies include large reference hierarchies of common terms used in\\nthe domain. For example, an ontology underlying an electronic medical-record system may\\ninclude a classification of various diseases. This classification may be just that—a hierarchy\\nof terms, without properties (or with the same set of properties). In that case, it is still useful\\nto organize the terms in a hierarchy rather than a flat list because it will (1) allow easier\\nexploration and navigation and (2) enable a doctor to choose easily a level of generality of\\nthe term that is appropriate for the situation.\\nAnother reason to introduce new classes without any new properties is to model concepts\\namong which domain experts commonly make a distinction even though we may have\\ndecided not to model the distinction itself. Since we use ontologies to facilitate\\ncommunication among domain experts and between domain experts and knowledge-based\\nsystems we would like to reflect the expert’s view of the domain in the ontology.\\nFinally, we should not create subclasses of a class for each additional restriction.  For\\nexample, we introduced the classes Red wine, White wine, and Rose wine  because\\nthis distinction is a natural one in the wine world. We did not introduce classes for delicate\\n                                                4 We chose to represent only red Ports in our ontology: white Ports do exist but they are extremely\\nuncommon.17wine, moderate wine, and so on. When defining a class hierarchy, our goal is to strike a\\nbalance between creating new classes useful for class organization and creating too many\\nclasses.\\n4.5 A new class or a property value?\\nWhen modeling a domain, we often need to decide whether to model a specific distinction\\n(such as white, red, or rosé wine) as a property value or as a set of classes again depends on\\nthe scope of the domain and the task at hand.  \\nDo we create a class White wine or do we simply create a class Wine and fill in different\\nvalues for the slot color? The answer usually lies in the scope that we defined for the\\nontology. How important the concept of White wine is in our domain? If wines have\\nonly marginal importance in the domain and whether or not the wine is white does not have\\nany particular implications for its relations to other objects, then we shouldn’t introduce a\\nseparate class for white wines. For a domain model used in a factory producing wine labels,\\nrules for wine labels of any color are the same and the distinction is not very important.\\nAlternatively, for the representation of wine, food, and their appropriate combinations a red\\nwine is very different from a white wine: it is paired with different foods, has different\\nproperties, and so on. Similarly, color of wine is important for the wines knowledge base that\\nwe may use to determine wine-tasting order.  Thus, we create a separate class for White\\nwine.\\nIf the concepts with different slot values become restrictions for different\\nslots in other classes, then we should create a new class for the distinction.\\nOtherwise, we represent the distinction in a slot value.\\nSimilarly, our wine ontology has such classes as Red Merlot and White Merlot, rather\\nthan a single class for all Merlot wines: red Merlots and white Merlots are really different\\nwines (made from the same grape) and if we are developing a detailed ontology of wine, this\\ndistinction is important.\\nIf a distinction is important in the domain and we think of the objects with\\ndifferent values for the distinction as different kinds of objects,  then we\\nshould create a new class for the distinction.\\nConsidering potential individual instances of a class may also be helpful in deciding whether\\nor not to introduce a new class.\\nA class to which an individual instance belongs should not change often.\\nUsually when we use extrinsic rather than intrinsic properties of concepts to differentiate\\namong classes, instances of those classes will have to migrate often from one class to\\nanother. For example, Chilled wine should not be a class in an ontology describing wine\\nbottles in a restaurant. The property chilled should simply be an attribute of wine in a\\nbottle since an instance of Chilled wine can easily cease being an instance of this class\\nand then become an instance of this class again.\\nUsually numbers, colors, locations are slot values and do not cause the creation of new\\nclasses. Wine, however, is a notable exception since the color of the wine is so paramount to\\nthe description of wine.\\nFor another example, consider the human-anatomy ontology. When we represent ribs, do we\\ncreate a class for each of the “1st left rib”, “2nd left rib”, and so on? Or do we have a class Rib\\nwith slots for the order and the lateral position (left-right)?5 If the information about each of\\nthe ribs that we represent in the ontology is significantly different, then we should indeed\\n                                                5 Here we assume that each anatomical organ is a class since we would also like to talk about “John’s 1st\\nleft rib.” Individual organs of existing people would be represented as individuals in our ontology.18create a class for each of the ribs. That is, if we want to represent details adjacency and\\nlocation information (which is different for each rib) as well as specific functions that each\\nrib playa and organs it protects, we want the classes. If we are modeling anatomy at a slightly\\nlesser level of generality, and all ribs are very similar as far as our potential applications are\\nconcerned (we just talk about which rib is broken on the X-Ray without implications for\\nother parts of the body), we may want to simplify our hierarchy and have just the class Rib,\\nwith two slots: lateral position , order.\\n4.6 An instance or a class?\\nDeciding whether a particular concept is a class in an ontology or an individual instance\\ndepends on what the potential applications of the ontology are. Deciding where classes end\\nand individual instances begin starts with deciding what is the lowest level of granularity in the\\nrepresentation. The level of granularity is in turn determined by a potential application of\\nthe ontology. In other words, what are the most specific items that are going to be\\nrepresented in the knowledge base? Going back to the competency questions we identified in\\nStep 1 in Section 3, the most specific concepts that will constitute answers to those questionsare very good candidates for individuals in the knowledge base.\\nIndividual instances are the most specific concepts represented in a\\nknowledge base.\\nFor example, if we are only going to talk about pairing wine with food we will not be\\ninterested in the specific physical bottles of wine. Therefore, such terms as Sterling\\nVineyards Merlot are probably going to be the most specific terms we use. In other\\nwords, the Wine class is a collection not of individual bottles of wines but rather of the\\nspecific wines produced by specific wineries. Therefore, Sterling Vineyards\\nMerlot would be an instance in the knowledge base.\\nOn the other hand, if we would like to maintain an inventory of wines in the restaurant in\\naddition to the knowledge base of good wine-food pairings, individual bottles of each wine\\nmay become individual instances in our knowledge base.\\nSimilarly, if we would like to record different properties for each specific vintage of the\\nSterling Vineyards Merlot, then the specific vintage of the wine is an instance in\\na knowledge base and Sterling Vineyards Merlot is a class containing instances for\\nall its vintages.\\nAnother rule can “move” some individual instances into the set of classes:\\nIf concepts form a natural hierarchy, then we should represent them as\\nclasses\\nConsider the wine regions. Initially, we may define main wine regions, such as France, United\\nStates, Germany, and so on, as classes and specific wine regions within these large regions as\\ninstances. For example, Bourgogne region is an instance of the French region\\nclass. However, we would also like to say that the Cotes d’Or region is a\\nBourgogne region. Therefore, Bourgogne region must be a class (in order to\\nhave subclasses or instances). However, making Bourgogne region a class and Cotes\\nd’Or region an instance of Bourgogne region seems arbitrary: it is very hard to\\nclearly distinguish which regions are classes and which are instances. Therefore, we define all\\nwine regions as classes. Protégé-2000 allows users to specify some classes as Abstract,\\nsignifying that the class cannot have any direct instances. In our case, all region classes are\\nabstract (Figure 8).19Figure 8. Hierarchy of wine regions. The \"A\" icons next to class names indicate that the classes are\\nabstract and cannot have any direct instances.\\nThe same class hierarchy would be incorrect if we omitted the word “region” from the class\\nnames. We cannot say that the class Alsace is a subclass of the class France: Alsace is\\nnot a kind of France. However, Alsace region is a kind of a French region.\\nOnly classes can be arranged in a hierarchy—knowledge-representation systems do not have a\\nnotion of sub-instance. Therefore, if there is a natural hierarchy among terms, such as in\\nterminological hierarchies from Section 4.2, we should define these terms as classes even\\nthough they may not have any instances of their own.\\n4.7 Limiting the scope\\nAs a final note on defining a class hierarchy, the following set of rules is always helpful in\\ndeciding when an ontology definition is complete:\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible information about the\\ndomain: you do not need to specialize (or generalize) more than you need\\nfor your application (at most one extra level each way).\\nFor our wine and food example, we do not need to know what paper is used for the labels or\\nhow to cook shrimp dishes.\\nSimilarly,\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible properties of and\\ndistinctions among classes in the hierarchy.\\nIn our ontology, we certainly do not include all the properties that a wine or food could have.\\nWe represented the most salient properties of the classes of items in our ontology.  Even\\nthough wine books would tell us the size of grapes, we have not included this knowledge.\\nSimilarly, we have not added all relationships that one could imagine among all the terms in\\nour system.  For example, we do not include relationships such as favorite wine and\\nfavorite food in the ontology just to allow a more complete representation of all of\\nthe interconnections between the terms we have defined.\\nThe last rule also applies to establishing relations among concepts that we have already\\nincluded in the ontology. Consider an ontology describing biology experiments. The ontology\\nwill likely contain a concept of Biological organisms . It will also contain a concept\\nof an Experimenter  performing an experiment (with his name, affiliation, etc.). It is true\\n20that an experimenter, as a person, also happens to be a biological organism. However, we\\nprobably should not incorporate this distinction in the ontology: for the purposes of this\\nrepresentation an experimenter is not a biological organism and we will probably never\\nconduct experiments on the experimenters themselves. If we were representing everything\\nwe can say about the classes in the ontology, an Experimenter  would become a subclass\\nof Biological Organism . However, we do not need to include this knowledge for the\\nforeseeable applications. In fact, including this type of additional classification for existing\\nclasses actually hurts: now an instance of an Experimenter will have slots for weight, age,\\nspecies, and other data pertaining to a  biological organism, but absolutely irrelevant in the\\ncontext of describing an experiment. However, we should record such design decision in the\\ndocumentation for the benefit of the users who will be looking at this ontology and who may\\nnot be aware of the application we had in mind.  Otherwise, people intending to reuse the\\nontology for other applications may try to use experimenter as a subclass of person without\\nknowing that the original modeling did not include that fact.\\n4.8 Disjoint subclasses\\nMany systems allow us to specify explicitly that several classes are disjoint . Classes are\\ndisjoint if they cannot have any instances in common. For example, the Dessert wine\\nand the White wine  classes in our ontology are not disjoint: there are many wines that\\nare instances of both. The Rothermel Trochenbierenauslese Riesling\\ninstance of the Sweet Riesling  class is one such example. At the same time, the Red\\nwine and the White wine classes are disjoint: no wine can be simultaneously red and\\nwhite. Specifying that classes are disjoint enables the system to validate the ontology better.\\nIf we declare the Red wine and the White wine classes to be disjoint and later create a\\nclass that is a subclass of both Riesling  (a subclass of White wine) and Port (a\\nsubclass of Red wine), a system can indicate that there is a modeling error.\\n5 Defining properties—more details\\nIn this section we discuss several more details to keep in mind when defining slots in the\\nontology (Step 5 and Step 6 in Section 3). Mainly, we discuss inverse slots and default values\\nfor a slot.\\n5.1 Inverse slots\\nA value of a slot may depend on a value of another slot. For example, if a wine was\\nproduced by a winery, then the winery produces  that wine. These two relations,\\nmaker and produces , are called inverse relations . Storing the information “in both\\ndirections” is redundant. When we know that a wine is produced by a winery, an application\\nusing the knowledge base can always infer the value for the inverse relation that the winery\\nproduces the wine. However, from the knowledge-acquisition perspective it is convenient to\\nhave both pieces of information explicitly available. This approach allows users to fill in the\\nwine in one case and the winery in another. The knowledge-acquisition system could then\\nautomatically fill in the value for the inverse relation insuring consistency of the knowledge\\nbase.\\nOur example has a pair of inverse slots: the maker slot of the Wine class and the\\nproduces  slot of the Winery class. When a user creates an instance of the Wine class\\nand fills in the value for the maker slot, the system automatically adds the newly created\\ninstance to the produces  slot of the corresponding Winery instance. For instance, when\\nwe say that Sterling Merlot is produced by the Sterling Vineyard winery, the system would21automatically add Sterling Merlot to the list of wines that the Sterling Vineyard winery\\nproduces. (Figure 9).\\nFigure 9. Instances with inverse slots. The slot produces  for the class Winery is an inverse of the\\nslot  maker for the class Wine. Filling in one of the slots triggers an automatic update of the other.\\n5.2 Default values\\nMany frame-based systems allow specification of default values for slots.  If a particular slot\\nvalue is the same for most instances of a class, we can define this value to be a default  value\\nfor the slot. Then, when each new instance of a class containing this slot is created, the\\nsystem fills in the default value automatically. We can then change the value to any other\\nvalue that the facets will allow. That is, default values are there for convenience: they do not\\nenforce any new restrictions on the model or change the model in any way.\\nFor example, if the majority of wines we are going to discuss are full-bodied wines, we can\\nhave “full” as a default value for the body of the wine. Then, unless we say otherwise, all\\nwines we define would be full-bodied.\\nNote that this is different from  slot values . Slot values cannot be changed. For example, we\\ncan say that the slot sugar has value SWEET for the Dessert wine class. Then all the\\nsubclasses and instances of the Dessert wine class will have the SWEET value for the\\nslot sugar. This value cannot be changed in any of the subclasses or instances of the class.\\n6 What’s in a name?\\nDefining naming conventions for concepts in an ontology and then strictly adhering to these\\nconventions not only makes the ontology easier to understand but also helps avoid some\\ncommon modeling mistakes. There are many alternatives in naming concepts. Often there is\\nno particular reason to choose one or another alternative. However, we need to\\nDefine a naming convention for classes and slots and adhere to it.\\nThe following features of a knowledge representation system affect the choice of naming\\n22conventions:\\n• Does the system have the same name space for classes, slots, and instances? That is,\\ndoes the system allow having a class and a slot with the same name (such as a class\\nwinery and a slot winery)?\\n• Is the system case-sensitive? That is, does the system treat the names that differ only\\nin case as different names (such as Winery and winery)?\\n• What delimiters does the system allow in the names? That is, can names contain\\nspaces, commas, asterisks, and so on?\\nProtégé-2000, for example, maintains a single name space for all its frames. It is case-\\nsensitive. Thus, we cannot have a class winery and a slot winery. We can, however, have\\na class Winery (note the upper-case) and a slot winery. CLASSIC, on the other hand, is\\nnot case sensitive and maintains different name spaces for classes, slots, and individuals.\\nThus, from a system perspective, there is no problem in naming both a class and a slot\\nWinery.\\n6.1 Capitalization and delimiters\\nFirst, we can greatly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent\\ncapitalization for concept names. For example, it is common to capitalize class names and\\nuse lower case for slot names (assuming the system is case-sensitive).\\nWhen a concept name contains more than one word (such as Meal course) we need to\\ndelimit the words. Here are some possible choices.\\n• Use Space: Meal course (many systems, including Protégé, allow spaces in\\nconcept names).  \\n• Run the words together and capitalize each new word: MealCourse\\n• Use an underscore or dash or other delimiter in the name: Meal_Course ,\\nMeal_course , Meal-Course , Meal-course . (If you use delimiters, you will\\nalso need to decide whether or not each new word is capitalized)\\nIf the knowledge-representation system allows spaces in names, using them may be the most\\nintuitive solution for many ontology developers. It is however, important to consider other\\nsystems with which your system may interact.  If those systems do not use spaces or if your\\npresentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method.\\n6.2 Singular or plural\\nA class name represents a collection of objects. For example, a class Wine actually\\nrepresents all wines. Therefore, it could be more natural for some designers to call the class\\nWines rather than Wine. No alternative is better or worse than the other (although singular\\nfor class names is used more often in practice). However, whatever the choice, it should be\\nconsistent throughout the whole ontology. Some systems even require their users to declare\\nin advance whether or not they are going to use singular or plural for concept names and do\\nnot allow them to stray from that choice.\\nUsing the same form all the time also prevents a designer from making such modeling\\nmistakes as creating a class Wines and then creating a class Wine as its subclass (see Section\\n4.1).\\n6.3 Prefix and suffix conventions\\nSome knowledge-base methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in the names\\nto distinguish between classes and slots.  Two common practices are to add a has- or a suffix\\n–of to slot names.  Thus, our slots become has-maker  and has-winery  if we chose the23has- convention. The slots become maker-of  and winery-of  if we chose the of-\\nconvention.  This approach allows anyone looking at a term to determine immediately if the\\nterm is a class or a slot.  However, the term names become slightly longer.\\n6.4 Other naming considerations\\nHere are a few more things to consider when defining naming conventions:\\n• Do not add strings such as “class”, “property”, “slot”, and so on to concept names.\\nIt is always clear form the context whether the concept is a class or a slot, for example. In\\naddition is you use different naming conventions for classes and slots (say, capitalization and\\nno capitalization respectively), the name itself would be indicative of what the concept is.\\n• It is usually a good idea to avoid abbreviations in concept names (that is, use\\nCabernet Sauvignon  rather than Cab)\\n• Names of direct subclasses of a class should either all include or not include the name\\nof the superclass. For example, if we are creating two subclasses of the Wine class to\\nrepresent red and white wines, the two subclass names should be either Red Wine\\nand White Wine or Red and White, but not Red Wine and White.\\n7 Other Resources\\nWe have used Protégé-2000 as an ontology-developing environment for our examples.\\nDuineveld and colleagues (Duineveld et al. 2000)  describe and compare a number of other\\nontology-development environments.  \\nWe have tried to address the very basics of ontology development and have not discussed\\nmany of the advanced topics or alternative methodologies for ontology development.\\nGómez-Pérez (Gómez-Pérez 1998)  and Uschold (Uschold and Gruninger 1996)  present\\nalternative ontology-development methodologies. The Ontolingua tutorial (Farquhar 1997)\\ndiscusses some formal aspects of knowledge modeling.   \\nCurrently, researchers emphasize not only ontology development, but also ontology analysis.\\nAs more ontologies are generated and reused, more tools will be available to analyze\\nontologies. For example, Chimaera (McGuinness et al. 2000)  provides diagnostic tools for\\nanalyzing ontologies. The analysis that Chimaera performs includes both a check for logical\\ncorrectness of an ontology and diagnostics of common ontology-design errors. An ontology\\ndesigner may want to run Chimaera diagnostics over the evolving ontology to determine the\\nconformance to common ontology-modeling practices.\\n8 Conclusions\\nIn this guide, we have described an ontology-development methodology for declarative\\nframe-based systems. We listed the steps in the ontology-development process and addressed\\nthe complex issues of defining class hierarchies and properties of classes and instances.\\nHowever, after following all the rules and suggestions, one of the most important things to\\nremember is the following: there is no single correct ontology for any domain . Ontology\\ndesign is a creative process and no two ontologies designed by different people would be the\\nsame. The potential applications of the ontology and the designer’s understanding and view\\nof the domain will undoubtedly affect ontology design choices. “The proof is in the\\npudding”—we can assess the quality of our ontology only by using it in applications for which\\nwe designed it.  24Acknowledgments\\nProtégé-2000 (http://protege.stanford.edu) was developed by Mark Musen’s group at StanfordMedical Informatics.

McGuinness\\nStanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305\\nnoy@smi.stanford.edu   and    dlm@ksl.stanford.edu\\n1 Why develop an ontology?\\nIn recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in\\nthe domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of\\nArtificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have\\nbecome common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large\\ntaxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for\\nsale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is\\ndeveloping the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for\\nencoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching\\nfor information.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in\\nconjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by\\nextending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the\\nWeb (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies\\nthat domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for\\nexample, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED  (Price and\\nSpackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System\\n(Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For\\nexample, the United Nations Development Program and Dun & Bradstreet combined their\\nefforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and\\nservices (www.unspsc.org).\\nAn ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in\\na domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and\\nrelations among them.\\nWhy would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:\\n• To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or\\nsoftware agents\\n• To enable reuse of domain knowledge\\n• To make domain assumptions explicit\\n• To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge\\n• To analyze domain knowledge\\nSharing common understanding of the structure of information among people or software\\nagents  is one of the more common goals in developing ontologies (Musen 1992; Gruber\\n1993). For example, suppose several different Web sites contain medical information or\\nprovide medical e-commerce services. If these Web sites share and publish the same\\nunderlying ontology of the terms they all use, then computer agents can extract and\\naggregate information from these different sites. The agents can use this aggregated\\ninformation to answer user queries or as input data to other applications.\\nEnabling reuse of domain knowledge  was one of the driving forces behind recent surge in\\nontology research. For example, models for many different domains need to represent the\\nnotion of time. This representation includes the notions of time intervals, points in time,\\nrelative measures of time, and so on. If one group of researchers develops such an ontology\\nin detail, others can simply reuse it for their domains. Additionally, if we need to build a large2ontology, we can integrate several existing ontologies describing portions of the large\\ndomain. We can also reuse a general ontology, such as the UNSPSC ontology, and extend it\\nto describe our domain of interest.\\nMaking explicit domain assumptions underlying an implementation makes it possible to\\nchange these assumptions easily if our knowledge about the domain changes. Hard-coding\\nassumptions about the world in programming-language code makes these assumptions not\\nonly hard to find and understand but also hard to change, in particular for someone without\\nprogramming expertise. In addition, explicit specifications of domain knowledge are useful\\nfor new users who must learn what terms in the domain mean.  \\nSeparating the domain knowledge from the operational knowledge is another common use\\nof ontologies. We can describe a task of configuring a product from its components according\\nto a required specification and implement a program that does this configuration independent\\nof the products and components themselves (McGuinness and Wright 1998). We can then\\ndevelop an ontology of PC-components and characteristics and apply the algorithm to\\nconfigure made-to-order PCs. We can also use the same algorithm to configure elevators if\\nwe “feed” an elevator component ontology to it (Rothenfluh et al. 1996).\\nAnalyzing domain knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is\\navailable.  Formal analysis of terms is extremely valuable when both attempting to reuse\\nexisting ontologies and extending them (McGuinness et al. 2000).\\nOften an ontology of the domain is not a goal in itself. Developing an ontology is akin to\\ndefining a set of data and their structure for other programs to use. Problem-solving methods,\\ndomain-independent applications, and software agents use ontologies and knowledge bases\\nbuilt from ontologies as data. For example, in this paper we develop an ontology of wine and\\nfood and appropriate combinations of wine with meals. This ontology can then be used as a\\nbasis for some applications in a suite of restaurant-managing tools: One application could\\ncreate wine suggestions for the menu of the day or answer queries of waiters and customers.\\nAnother application could analyze an inventory list of a wine cellar and suggest which wine\\ncategories to expand and which particular wines to purchase for upcoming menus or\\ncookbooks.\\nAbout this guide\\nWe build on our experience using Protégé-2000 (Protege 2000) , Ontolingua (Ontolingua\\n1997) , and Chimaera (Chimaera 2000)  as ontology-editing environments. In this guide, we\\nuse Protégé-2000 for our examples.\\nThe wine and food example that we use throughout this guide is loosely based on an example\\nknowledge base presented in a paper describing CLASSIC—a knowledge-representation\\nsystem based on a description-logics approach (Brachman et al. 1991) . The CLASSIC tutorial\\n(McGuinness et al. 1994)  has developed this example further. Protégé-2000 and other\\nframe-based systems describe ontologies declaratively, stating explicitly what the class\\nhierarchy is and to which classes individuals belong.\\nSome ontology-design ideas in this guide originated from the literature on object-oriented\\ndesign (Rumbaugh et al. 1991; Booch et al. 1997). However, ontology development is\\ndifferent from designing classes and relations in object-oriented programming. Object-\\noriented programming centers primarily around methods on classes—a programmer makes\\ndesign decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontology designer\\nmakes these decisions based on the structural  properties of a class. As a result, a class\\nstructure and relations among classes in an ontology are different from the structure for a\\nsimilar domain in an object-oriented program.\\nIt is impossible to cover all the issues that an ontology developer may need to grapple with\\nand we are not trying to address all of them in this guide. Instead, we try to provide a starting\\npoint; an initial guide that would help a new ontology designer to develop ontologies. At the3end, we suggest places to look for explanations of more complicated structures and design\\nmechanisms if the domain requires them.\\nFinally, there is no single correct ontology-design methodology and we did not attempt to\\ndefine one. The ideas that we present here are the ones that we found useful in our own\\nontology-development experience. At the end of this guide we suggest a list of references for\\nalternative methodologies.\\n2 What is in an ontology?\\nThe Artificial-Intelligence literature contains many definitions of an ontology; many of\\nthese contradict one another. For the purposes of this guide an ontology  is a formal explicit\\ndescription of concepts in a domain of discourse (classes (sometimes called concepts )),\\nproperties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept (slots\\n(sometimes called  roles or properties )), and restrictions on slots (facets (sometimes called\\nrole restrictions )). An ontology together with a set of individual instances  of classes\\nconstitutes a knowledge base . In reality, there is a fine line where the ontology ends and\\nthe knowledge base begins.\\nClasses are the focus of most ontologies. Classes describe concepts in the domain. For\\nexample, a class of wines represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class. The\\nBordeaux wine in the glass in front of you while you read this document is an instance of the\\nclass of Bordeaux wines. A class can have subclasses  that represent concepts that are more\\nspecific than the superclass. For example, we can divide the class of all wines into red, white,\\nand rosé wines. Alternatively, we can divide a class of all wines into sparkling and non-\\nsparkling wines.  \\nSlots  describe properties of classes and instances: Château Lafite Rothschild\\nPauillac  wine has a full body; it is produced by the Château Lafite Rothschild\\nwinery. We have two slots describing the wine in this example: the slot body with the value\\nfull and the slot maker with the value Château Lafite Rothschild  winery. At the\\nclass level, we can say that instances of the class Wine will have slots describing their\\nflavor, body, sugar level, the maker of the wine and so on.1\\nAll instances of the class Wine, and its subclass Pauillac, have a slot maker the value of\\nwhich is an instance of the class Winery (Figure 1). All instances of the class Winery have a\\nslot produces  that refers to all the wines (instances of the class Wine and its subclasses)\\nthat the winery produces.\\nIn practical terms, developing an ontology includes:\\n• defining classes in the ontology,\\n• arranging the classes in a taxonomic (subclass–superclass) hierarchy,\\n• defining slots and describing allowed values for these slots,\\n• filling in the values for slots for instances.\\nWe can then create a knowledge base by defining individual instances of these classes filling in\\nspecific slot value information and additional slot restrictions.\\n                                                1 We capitalize class names and start slot names with low-case letters. We also use typewriter font  for\\nall terms from the example ontology.4Figure 1.  Some classes, instances, and relations among them in the wine domain.  We used black\\nfor classes and red for instances. Direct links represent slots and internal links such as instance-of\\nand subclass-of.\\n3 A Simple Knowledge-Engineering Methodology\\nAs we said earlier, there is no one “correct” way or methodology for developing ontologies.\\nHere we discuss general issues to consider and offer one possible process for developing an\\nontology. We describe an iterative approach to ontology development: we start with a rough\\nfirst pass at the ontology. We then revise and refine the evolving ontology and fill in the\\ndetails. Along the way, we discuss the modeling decisions that a designer needs to make, as\\nwell as the pros, cons, and implications of different solutions.\\nFirst, we would like to emphasize some fundamental rules in ontology design to which we will\\nrefer many times. These rules may seem rather dogmatic. They can help, however, to make\\ndesign decisions in many cases.\\n1) There is no one correct way to model a domain— there are always\\nviable alternatives. The best solution almost always depends on the\\napplication that you have in mind and the extensions that you anticipate.\\n2) Ontology development is necessarily an iterative process.\\n3) Concepts in the ontology should be close to objects (physical or logical)\\nand relationships in your domain of interest. These are most likely to be\\nnouns (objects) or verbs (relationships) in sentences that describe your\\ndomain.\\nThat is, deciding what we are going to use the ontology for, and how detailed or general the\\nontology is going to be will guide many of the modeling decisions down the road. Among\\nseveral viable alternatives, we will need to determine which one would work better for the\\nprojected task, be more intuitive, more extensible, and more maintainable. We also need to\\nremember that an ontology is a model of reality of the world and the concepts in the\\nontology must reflect this reality. After we define an initial version of the ontology, we can\\nevaluate and debug it by using it in applications or problem-solving methods or by discussing\\nit with experts in the field, or both. As a result, we will almost certainly need to revise the\\ninitial ontology. This process of iterative design will likely continue through the entire\\nlifecycle of the ontology.\\n5Step 1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology\\nWe suggest starting the development of an ontology by defining its domain and scope. That\\nis, answer several basic questions:\\n• What is the domain that the ontology will cover?\\n• For what we are going to use the ontology?\\n• For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?\\n• Who will use and maintain the ontology?\\nThe answers to these questions may change during the ontology-design process, but at any\\ngiven time they help limit the scope of the model.\\nConsider the ontology of wine and food that we introduced earlier. Representation of food\\nand wines is the domain of the ontology. We plan to use this ontology for the applications\\nthat suggest good combinations of wines and food.\\nNaturally, the concepts describing different types of wines, main food types, the notion of a\\ngood combination of wine and food and a bad combination will figure into our ontology. At\\nthe same time, it is unlikely that the ontology will include concepts for managing inventory\\nin a winery or employees in a restaurant even though these concepts are somewhat related to\\nthe notions of wine and food.\\nIf the ontology we are designing will be used to assist in natural language processing of articles\\nin wine magazines, it may be important to include synonyms and part-of-speech information\\nfor concepts in the ontology. If the ontology will be used to help restaurant customers decide\\nwhich wine to order, we need to include retail-pricing information.  If it is used for wine\\nbuyers in stocking a wine cellar, wholesale pricing and availability may be necessary.  If the\\npeople who will maintain the ontology describe the domain in a language that is different\\nfrom the language of the ontology users, we may need to provide the mapping between the\\nlanguages.\\nCompetency questions.\\nOne of the ways to determine the scope of the ontology is to sketch a list of questions that a\\nknowledge base based on the ontology should be able to answer, competency questions\\n(Gruninger and Fox 1995) . These questions will serve as the litmus test later: Does the\\nontology contain enough information to answer these types of questions? Do the answers\\nrequire a particular level of detail or representation of a particular area? These competency\\nquestions are just a sketch and do not need to be exhaustive.\\nIn the wine and food domain, the following are the possible competency questions:\\n• Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?\\n• Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?\\n• Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?\\n• What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?\\n• Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?\\n• Does a bouquet or body of a specific wine change with vintage year?\\n• What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?\\nJudging from this list of questions, the ontology will include the information on various wine\\ncharacteristics and wine types, vintage years—good and bad ones—classifications of foods\\nthat matter for choosing an appropriate wine, recommended combinations of wine and food.\\nStep 2. Consider reusing existing ontologies\\nIt is almost always worth considering what someone else has done and checking if we can\\nrefine and extend existing sources for our particular domain and task. Reusing existing6ontologies may be a requirement if our system needs to interact with other applications that\\nhave already committed to particular ontologies or controlled vocabularies.  Many ontologies\\nare already available in electronic form and can be imported into an ontology-development\\nenvironment that you are using. The formalism in which an ontology is expressed often does\\nnot matter, since many knowledge-representation systems can import and export ontologies.\\nEven if a knowledge-representation system cannot work directly with a particular formalism,\\nthe task of translating an ontology from one formalism to another is usually not a difficult\\none.\\nThere are libraries of reusable ontologies on the Web and in the literature. For example, we\\ncan use the Ontolingua ontology library (http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/software/ontolingua/) orthe DAML ontology library (http://www.daml.org/ontologies/).  There are also a number ofpublicly available commercial ontologies (e.g., UNSPSC (www.unspsc.org), RosettaNet\\n(www.rosettanet.org), DMOZ (www.dmoz.org)).\\nFor example, a knowledge base of French wines may already exist. If we can import this\\nknowledge base and the ontology on which it is based, we will have not only the classification\\nof French wines but also the first pass at the classification of wine characteristics used to\\ndistinguish and describe the wines. Lists of wine properties may already be available from\\ncommercial Web sites such as www.wines.com that customers consider use to buy wines.For this guide however we will assume that no relevant ontologies already exist and start\\ndeveloping the ontology from scratch.\\nStep 3. Enumerate important terms in the ontology\\nIt is useful to write down a list of all terms we would like either to make statements about or\\nto explain to a user. What are the terms we would like to talk about? What properties do\\nthose terms have? What would we like to say about those terms? For example, important\\nwine-related terms will include wine, grape, winery, location , a wine’s color,\\nbody, flavor and sugar content; different types of food, such as fish and red\\nmeat; subtypes of wine such as white wine, and so on. Initially, it is important to get a\\ncomprehensive list of terms without worrying about overlap between concepts they\\nrepresent, relations among the terms, or any properties that the concepts may have, or\\nwhether the concepts are classes or slots.\\nThe next two steps—developing the class hierarchy and defining properties of concepts\\n(slots)—are closely intertwined. It is hard to do one of them first and then do the other.\\nTypically, we create a few definitions of the concepts in the hierarchy and then continue by\\ndescribing properties of these concepts and so on. These two steps are also the most\\nimportant steps in the ontology-design process. We will describe them here briefly and then\\nspend the next two sections discussing the more complicated issues that need to be\\nconsidered, common pitfalls, decisions to make, and so on.\\nStep 4. Define the classes and the class hierarchy\\nThere are several possible approaches in developing a class hierarchy (Uschold and\\nGruninger 1996) :\\n• A top-down  development process starts with the definition of the most general\\nconcepts in the domain and subsequent specialization of the concepts. For example,\\nwe can start with creating classes for the general concepts of Wine and Food. Then\\nwe specialize the Wine class by creating some of its subclasses: White wine, Red\\nwine, Rosé wine. We can further categorize the Red wine class, for example,\\ninto Syrah, Red Burgundy , Cabernet Sauvignon , and so on.7• A bottom-up  development process starts with the definition of the most specific\\nclasses, the leaves of the hierarchy, with subsequent grouping of these classes into\\nmore general concepts. For example, we start by defining classes for Pauillac  and\\nMargaux wines. We then create a common superclass for these two\\nclasses— Medoc—which in turn is a subclass of Bordeaux .\\n• A combination  development process is a combination of the top-down and bottom-\\nup approaches: We define the more salient concepts first and then generalize and\\nspecialize them appropriately. We might start with a few top-level concepts such as\\nWine, and a few specific concepts, such as Margaux . We can then relate them to a\\nmiddle-level concept, such as Medoc.  Then we may want to generate all of the\\nregional wine classes from France, thereby generating a number of middle-level\\nconcepts.\\nFigure 2 shows a possible breakdown among the different levels of generality.\\nFigure 2. The different levels of the Wine taxonomy: Wine is the most general concept.  Red wine,\\nWhite wine,  and Rosé wine are general  top level concepts.   Pauillac  and Margaux are the\\nmost specific classes in the hierarchy (or the bottom level concepts).\\nNone of these three methods is inherently better than any of the others. The approach to\\ntake depends strongly on the personal view of the domain. If a developer has a systematic\\ntop-down view of the domain, then it may be easier to use the top-down approach. The\\ncombination approach is often the easiest for many ontology developers, since the concepts\\n“in the middle” tend to be the more descriptive concepts in the domain (Rosch 1978) .\\nIf you tend to think of wines by distinguishing the most general classification first, then the\\ntop-down approach may work better for you. If you’d rather start by getting grounded with\\nspecific examples, the bottom-up approach may be more appropriate.\\nWhichever approach we choose, we usually start by defining classes. From the list created in\\nStep 3, we select the terms that describe objects having independent existence rather than\\nterms that describe these objects. These terms will be classes in the ontology and will become8anchors in the class hierarchy.2 We organize the classes into a hierarchical taxonomy by\\nasking if by being an instance of one class, the object will necessarily (i.e., by definition) be\\nan instance of some other class.\\nIf a class A is a superclass of class B, then every instance of B is also an\\ninstance of A\\nIn other words, the class B represents a concept that is a “kind of” A.\\nFor example, every Pinot Noir wine is necessarily a red wine. Therefore the Pinot Noir\\nclass is a subclass of the Red Wine class.\\nFigure 2 shows a part of the class hierarchy for the Wine ontology. Section 4 contains a\\ndetailed discussion of things to look for when defining a class hierarchy.\\nFigure 3. The slots for the class Wine and the facets for these slots. The “I” icon next to the maker\\nslot indicates that the slot has an inverse (Section 5.1)\\nStep 5. Define the properties of classes—slots\\nThe classes alone will not provide enough information to answer the competency questions\\nfrom Step 1. Once we have defined some of the classes, we must describe the internal\\nstructure of concepts.\\nWe have already selected classes from the list of terms we created in Step 3. Most of the\\nremaining terms are likely to be properties of these classes. These terms include, for\\nexample, a wine’s color, body, flavor and sugar content and location  of a\\nwinery.\\nFor each property in the list, we must determine which class it describes. These properties\\nbecome slots attached to classes. Thus, the Wine class will have the following slots: color,\\nbody, flavor, and sugar. And the class Winery will have a location slot.\\nIn general, there are several types of object properties that can become slots in an ontology:\\n• “intrinsic” properties such as the flavor of a wine;\\n• “extrinsic” properties such as a wine’s name, and area it comes from;\\n• parts, if the object is structured; these can be both physical and abstract “parts” (e.g.,\\nthe courses of a meal)\\n• relationships to other individuals; these are the relationships between individual\\nmembers of the class and other items (e.g., the maker of a wine, representing a\\nrelationship between a wine and a winery, and the grape the wine is made from.)\\nThus, in addition to the properties we have identified earlier, we need to add the following\\n                                                2 We can also view classes as unary predicates—questions that have one argument.  For example, “Is this\\nobject a wine?”  Unary predicates (or classes) contrast with binary predicates (or slots)—questions that have\\ntwo arguments.  For example, “Is the flavor of this object strong?” “What is the flavor of this object?”\\n9slots to the Wine class: name, area, maker, grape. Figure 3 shows the slots for the class\\nWine.\\nAll subclasses of a class inherit  the slot of that class. For example, all the slots of the class\\nWine will be inherited to all subclasses of Wine, including Red Wine and White Wine.\\nWe will add an additional slot, tannin level (low, moderate, or high), to the Red\\nWine class. The tannin level slot will be inherited by all the classes representing red\\nwines (such as Bordeaux  and Beaujolais ).\\nA slot should be attached at the most general class that can have that property. For instance,\\nbody and color of a wine should be attached at the class Wine, since it is the most general\\nclass whose instances will have body and color.  \\nStep 6. Define the facets of the slots\\nSlots can have different facets describing the value type, allowed values, the number of the\\nvalues (cardinality), and other features of the values the slot can take. For example, the value\\nof a name slot (as in “the name of a wine”) is one string. That is, name is a slot with value\\ntype String. A slot produces  (as in “a winery produces  these wines”) can have multiple\\nvalues and the values are instances of the class Wine. That is, produces  is a slot with value\\ntype Instance  with Wine as allowed class.\\nWe will now describe several common facets.\\nSlot cardinality\\nSlot cardinality defines how many values a slot can have. Some systems distinguish only\\nbetween single cardinality (allowing at most one value) and multiple cardinality (allowing any\\nnumber of values). A body of a wine will be a single cardinality slot (a wine can have only\\none body). Wines produced by a particular winery fill in a multiple-cardinality slot\\nproduces  for a Winery class.\\nSome systems allow specification of a minimum and maximum cardinality to describe the\\nnumber of slot values more precisely. Minimum cardinality of N means that a slot must have\\nat least N values. For example, the grape slot of a Wine has a minimum cardinality of 1:\\neach wine is made of at least one variety of grape. Maximum cardinality of M means that a\\nslot can have at most M values. The maximum cardinality for the grape slot for single\\nvarietal wines is 1: these wines are made from only one variety of grape. Sometimes it may\\nbe useful to set the maximum cardinality to 0. This setting would indicate that the slot\\ncannot have any values for a particular subclass.\\nSlot-value type\\nA value-type facet describes what types of values can fill in the slot. Here is a list of the more\\ncommon value types:\\n• String  is the simplest value type which is used for slots such as name: the value is a\\nsimple string\\n• Number  (sometimes more specific value types of Float and Integer are used)\\ndescribes slots with numeric values. For example, a price of a wine can have a value\\ntype Float\\n• Boolean  slots are simple yes–no flags. For example, if we choose not to represent\\nsparkling wines as a separate class, whether or not a wine is sparkling can be\\nrepresented as a value of a Boolean slot: if the value is “true” (“yes”) the wine is\\nsparkling and if the value is “false” (“no”) the wine is not a sparkling one.\\n• Enumerated slots specify a list of specific allowed values for the slot. For example,\\nwe can specify that the flavor slot can take on one of the three possible values:10strong, moderate , and delicate . In Protégé-2000 the enumerated slots are of\\ntype Symbol.\\n• Instance -type slots allow definition of relationships between individuals. Slots with\\nvalue type Instance must also define a list of allowed classes from which the instances\\ncan come. For example, a slot produces  for the class Winery may have instances\\nof the class Wine as its values.3\\nFigure 4 shows a definition of the slot produces  at the class Winery.\\nFigure 4. The definition of a slot produces  that describes the wines produced by a winery. The\\nslot has cardinality multiple, value type Instance, and the class Wine as the allowed class for its\\nvalues.\\nDomain and range of a slot\\nAllowed classes for slots of type Instance are often called a range  of a slot. In the example\\nin Figure 4 the class Wine is the range of the produces  slot. Some systems allow\\nrestricting the range of a slot when the slot is attached for a particular class.\\nThe classes to which a slot is attached or a classes which property a slot describes, are called\\nthe domain  of the slot. The Winery class is the domain of the produces  slot. In the\\nsystems where we attach  slots to classes, the classes to which the slot is attached usually\\nconstitute the domain of that slot. There is no need to specify the domain separately.\\nThe basic rules for determining a domain and a range of a slot are similar:\\nWhen defining a domain or a range for a slot, find the most general classes\\nor class that can be respectively the domain or the range for the slots .\\nOn the other hand, do not define a domain and range that is overly\\ngeneral: all the classes in the domain of a slot should be described by the\\nslot and instances of all the classes in the range of a slot should be potential\\nfillers for the slot.  Do not choose an overly general class for range (i.e.,\\none would not want to make the range THING) but one would want to\\nchoose a class that will cover all fillers\\nInstead of listing all possible subclasses of the Wine class for the range of the produces\\n                                                3 Some systems just specify value type with a class instead of requiring a special statement of instance\\ntype slots.\\n11slot, just list Wine. At the same time, we do not want to specify the range of the slot as\\nTHING—the most general class in an ontology.\\nIn more specific terms:\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot includes a class\\nand its subclass, remove the subclass.\\nIf the range of the slot contains both the Wine class and the Red Wine class, we can\\nremove the Red Wine from the range because it does not add any new information: The\\nRed Wine is a subclass of Wine and therefore the slot range already implicitly includes it as\\nwell as all other subclasses of the Wine class.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all\\nsubclasses of a class A, but not the class A itself, the range should contain\\nonly the class A and not the subclasses.\\nInstead of defining the range of the slot to include Red Wine, White Wine, and Rose\\nWine (enumerating all the direct subclasses of Wine), we can limit the range to the class\\nWine itself.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all but a\\nfew subclasses of a class A, consider if the class A would make a more\\nappropriate range definition.\\nIn systems where attaching a slot to a class is the same as adding the class to the domain of\\nthe slot, the same rules apply to slot attachment: On the one hand, we should try to make it\\nas general as possible. On the other hand, we must ensure that each class to which we attach\\nthe slot can indeed have the property that the slot represents. We can attach the tannin\\nlevel slot to each of the classes representing red wines (e.g., Bordeaux , Merlot,\\nBeaujolais , etc.). However, since all red wines have the tannin-level property, we should\\ninstead attach the slot to this more general class of Red Wines. Generalizing the domain of\\nthe tannin level slot further (by attaching it to the Wine class instead) would not be\\ncorrect since we do not use tannin level to describe white wines for example.\\nStep 7. Create instances\\nThe last step is creating individual instances of classes in the hierarchy. Defining an individual\\ninstance of a class requires (1) choosing a class, (2) creating an individual instance of that\\nclass, and (3) filling in the slot values. For example, we can create an individual instance\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  to represent a specific type of Beaujolais wine.\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  is an instance of the class Beaujolais  representing\\nall Beaujolais wines. This instance has the following slot values defined (Figure 5):\\n• Body:  Light\\n• Color:  Red\\n• Flavor:  Delicate\\n• Tannin level: Low\\n• Grape:  Gamay (instance of the Wine grape class)\\n• Maker: Chateau-Morgon (instance of the Winery class)\\n• Region:  Beaujolais (instance of the Wine-Region  class)12• Sugar:  Dry\\nFigure 5. The definition of an instance of the Beaujolais  class. The instance is Chateaux\\nMorgon Beaujolais  from the Beaujolais region, produced from the Gamay grape by the\\nChateau Morgon winery. It has a light body, delicate flavor, red color, and low tannin level. It is a\\ndry wine.\\n4 Defining classes and a class hierarchy\\nThis section discusses things to look out for and errors that are easy to make when defining\\nclasses and a class hierarchy (Step 4 from Section 3). As we have mentioned before, there is\\nno single correct class hierarchy for any given domain. The hierarchy depends on the\\npossible uses of the ontology, the level of the detail that is necessary for the application,\\npersonal preferences, and sometimes requirements for compatibility with other models.\\nHowever, we discuss several guidelines to keep in mind when developing a class hierarchy.\\nAfter defining a considerable number of new classes, it is helpful to stand back and check if\\nthe emerging hierarchy conforms to these guidelines.\\n4.1 Ensuring that the class hierarchy is correct\\nAn “is-a” relation\\nThe class hierarchy represents an “is-a” relation: a class A is a subclass of B if every instance\\nof A is also an instance of B. For example, Chardonnay  is a subclass of White wine.\\nAnother way to think of the taxonomic relation is as a “kind-of” relation: Chardonnay  is\\na kind of White wine. A jetliner is a kind of an aircraft. Meat is a kind of food.\\nA subclass of a class represents a concept that is a “kind of” the concept\\nthat the superclass represents.\\nA single wine is not a subclass of all wines\\nA common modeling mistake is to include both a singular and a plural version of the same\\nconcept in the hierarchy making the former a subclass of the latter. For example, it is wrong\\nto define a class Wines and a class Wine as a subclass of Wines. Once you think of the\\nhierarchy as representing the “kind-of” relationship, the modeling error becomes clear: a\\nsingle Wine is not a kind of Wines. The best way to avoid such an error is always to use\\neither singular or plural in naming classes (see Section 6 for the discussion on naming\\n13concepts).\\nTransitivity of the hierarchical relations\\nA subclass relationship is transitive:\\nIf B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, then C is a subclass of A\\nFor example, we can define a class Wine, and then define a class White wine as a subclass\\nof Wine. Then we define a class Chardonnay  as a subclass of White wine. Transitivity\\nof the subclass relationship means that the class Chardonnay is also a subclass of Wine.\\nSometimes we distinguish between direct subclasses and indirect subclasses. A direct subclass\\nis the “closest” subclass of the class: there are no classes between a class and its direct subclass\\nin a hierarchy. That is, there are no other classes in the hierarchy between a class and its\\ndirect superclass. In our example, Chardonnay  is a direct subclass of White wine and is\\nnot a direct subclass of Wine.\\nEvolution of a class hierarchy\\nMaintaining a consistent class hierarchy may become challenging as domains evolve. For\\nexample, for many years, all Zinfandel wines were red. Therefore, we define a class of\\nZinfandel  wines as a subclass of the Red wine class. Sometimes, however, wine makers\\nbegan to press the grapes and to take away the color-producing aspects of the grapes\\nimmediately, thereby modifying the color of the resulting wine. Thus, we get “white\\nzinfandel” whose color is rose. Now we need to break the Zinfandel  class into two classes\\nof zinfandel— White zinfandel  and Red zinfandel —and classify them as\\nsubclasses of Rose wine and Red wine respectively.  \\nClasses and their names\\nIt is important to distinguish between a class and its name:\\nClasses represent concepts in the domain and not the words that denote\\nthese concepts.\\nThe name of a class may change if we choose a different terminology, but the term itself\\nrepresents the objective reality in the world. For example, we may create a class Shrimps,\\nand then rename it to Prawns—the class still represents the same concept. Appropriate\\nwine combinations that referred to shrimp dishes should refer to prawn dishes. In more\\npractical terms, the following rule should always be followed:\\nSynonyms for the same concept do not represent different classes\\nSynonyms are just different names for a concept or a term. Therefore, we should not have a\\nclass called Shrimp and a class called Prawn, and, possibly a class called Crevette .\\nRather, there is one class, named either Shrimp or Prawn. Many systems allow associating\\na list of synonyms, translations, or presentation names with a class. If a system does not\\nallow these associations, synonyms could always be listed in the class documentation.\\nAvoiding class cycles\\nWe should avoid cycles  in the class hierarchy. We say that there is a cycle in a hierarchy\\nwhen some class A has a subclass B and at the same time B is a superclass of A. Creating such\\na cycle in a hierarchy amounts to declaring that the classes A and B are equivalent: all\\ninstances of A are instances of B and all instances of B are also instances of A. Indeed, since\\nB is a subclass of A, all B’s instances must be instances of the class A. Since A is a subclass of\\nB, all A’s instances must also be instances of the class B.144.2 Analyzing siblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings  in the hierarchy are classes that are direct subclasses of the same class (see Section\\n4.1).\\nAll the siblings in the hierarchy (except for the ones at the root) must be at\\nthe same level of generality.\\nFor example, White wine and Chardonnay  should not be subclasses of the same class\\n(say, Wine). White wine is a more general concept than Chardonnay . Siblings should\\nrepresent concepts that fall “along the same line” in the same way that same-level sections\\nin a book are at the same level of generality. In that sense, requirements for a class hierarchy\\nare similar to the requirements for a book outline.\\nThe concepts at the root of the hierarchy however (which are often represented as direct\\nsubclasses of some very general class, such as Thing) represent major divisions of the\\ndomain and do not have to be similar concepts.\\nHow many is too many and how few are too few?\\nThere are no hard rules for the number of direct subclasses that a class should have. However,\\nmany well-structured ontologies have between two and a dozen direct subclasses. Therefore,\\nwe have the following two guidelines:\\nIf a class has only one direct subclass there may be a modeling problem or\\nthe ontology is not complete.\\nIf there are more than a dozen subclasses for a given class then additional\\nintermediate categories may be necessary.\\nThe first of the two rules is similar to a typesetting rule that bulleted lists should never have\\nonly one bullet point. For example, most of the red Burgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines.\\nSuppose we wanted to represent only this majority type of Burgundy wines. We could create a\\nclass Red Burgundy  and then a single subclass Cotes d’Or (Figure 6a). However, if in\\nour representation red Burgundy and Côtes d’Or wines are essentially equivalent (all red\\nBurgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines and all Côtes d’Or wines are red Burgundy wines),\\ncreating the Cotes d’Or class is not necessary and does not add any new information to\\nthe representation. If we were to include Côtes Chalonnaise wines, which are cheaper\\nBurgundy wines from the region just South of Côtes d’Or, then we will create two subclasses\\nof the Burgundy  class: Cotes d’Or and Cotes Chalonnaise  (Figure 6b).\\nFigure 6. Subclasses of the Red Burgundy  class. Having a single subclass of a class usually\\npoints to a problem in modeling.\\nSuppose now that we list all types of wines as direct subclasses of the Wine class. This list\\nwould then include such more general types of wine as Beaujolais and Bordeaux, as well as\\nmore specific types such as Paulliac and Margaux (Figure 6a). The class Wine has too many\\ndirect subclasses and, indeed, for the ontology to reflect the different types of wine in a more\\norganized manner, Medoc should be a subclass of Bordeaux  and Cotes d’Or should be a\\n15subclass of Burgundy . Also having such intermediate categories as Red wine and White\\nwine would also reflect the conceptual model of the domain of wines that many people have\\n(Figure 6b).\\nHowever, if no natural classes exist to group concepts in the long list of siblings, there is no\\nneed to create artificial classes—just leave the classes the way they are. After all, the\\nontology is a reflection of the real world, and if no categorization exists in the real world,\\nthen the ontology should reflect that.\\nFigure 7. Categorizing wines. Having all the wines and types of wine versus having several levels of\\ncategorization.\\n4.3 Multiple inheritance\\nMost knowledge-representation systems allow multiple inheritance  in the class hierarchy:\\na class can be a subclass of several classes. Suppose we would like to create a separate class of\\ndessert wines, the Dessert wine class. The Port wine is both a red wine and a dessert\\n16wine.4 Therefore, we define a class Port to have two superclasses: Red wine and\\nDessert wine. All instances of the Port class will be instances of both the Red wine\\nclass and the Dessert wine class. The Port class will inherit its slots and their facets\\nfrom both its parents. Thus, it will inherit the value SWEET for the slot Sugar from the\\nDessert wine class and the tannin level slot and the value for its color slot from\\nthe Red wine class.\\n4.4 When to introduce a new class (or not)\\nOne of the hardest decisions to make during modeling is when to introduce a new class or\\nwhen to represent a distinction through different property values. It is hard to navigate both\\nan extremely nested hierarchy with many extraneous classes and a very flat hierarchy that\\nhas too few classes with too much information encoded in slots. Finding the appropriate\\nbalance though is not easy.\\nThere are several rules of thumb that help decide when to introduce new classes in a\\nhierarchy.\\nSubclasses of a class usually (1) have additional properties that the\\nsuperclass does not have, or (2) restrictions different from those of the\\nsuperclass, or (3) participate in different relationships than the\\nsuperclasses\\nRed wines can have different levels of tannin, whereas this property is not used to describe\\nwines in general. The value for the sugar slot of the Dessert wine is SWEET, whereas it is not\\ntrue of the superclass of the Dessert Wine class. Pinot Noir wines may go well with seafood\\nwhereas other red wines do not. In other words, we introduce a new class in the hierarchy\\nusually only when there is something that we can say about this class that we cannot say\\nabout the superclass.\\nIn practical terms, each subclass should either have new slots added to it, or have new slot\\nvalues defined, or override some facets for the inherited slots.\\nHowever, sometimes it may be useful to create new classes even if they do not introduce any\\nnew properties.\\nClasses in terminological hierarchies do not have to introduce new\\nproperties\\nFor example, some ontologies include large reference hierarchies of common terms used in\\nthe domain. For example, an ontology underlying an electronic medical-record system may\\ninclude a classification of various diseases. This classification may be just that—a hierarchy\\nof terms, without properties (or with the same set of properties). In that case, it is still useful\\nto organize the terms in a hierarchy rather than a flat list because it will (1) allow easier\\nexploration and navigation and (2) enable a doctor to choose easily a level of generality of\\nthe term that is appropriate for the situation.\\nAnother reason to introduce new classes without any new properties is to model concepts\\namong which domain experts commonly make a distinction even though we may have\\ndecided not to model the distinction itself. Since we use ontologies to facilitate\\ncommunication among domain experts and between domain experts and knowledge-based\\nsystems we would like to reflect the expert’s view of the domain in the ontology.\\nFinally, we should not create subclasses of a class for each additional restriction.

The answer usually lies in the scope that we defined for the\\nontology. How important the concept of White wine is in our domain? If wines have\\nonly marginal importance in the domain and whether or not the wine is white does not have\\nany particular implications for its relations to other objects, then we shouldn’t introduce a\\nseparate class for white wines. For a domain model used in a factory producing wine labels,\\nrules for wine labels of any color are the same and the distinction is not very important.\\nAlternatively, for the representation of wine, food, and their appropriate combinations a red\\nwine is very different from a white wine: it is paired with different foods, has different\\nproperties, and so on. Similarly, color of wine is important for the wines knowledge base that\\nwe may use to determine wine-tasting order.  Thus, we create a separate class for White\\nwine.\\nIf the concepts with different slot values become restrictions for different\\nslots in other classes, then we should create a new class for the distinction.\\nOtherwise, we represent the distinction in a slot value.\\nSimilarly, our wine ontology has such classes as Red Merlot and White Merlot, rather\\nthan a single class for all Merlot wines: red Merlots and white Merlots are really different\\nwines (made from the same grape) and if we are developing a detailed ontology of wine, this\\ndistinction is important.\\nIf a distinction is important in the domain and we think of the objects with\\ndifferent values for the distinction as different kinds of objects,  then we\\nshould create a new class for the distinction.\\nConsidering potential individual instances of a class may also be helpful in deciding whether\\nor not to introduce a new class.\\nA class to which an individual instance belongs should not change often.\\nUsually when we use extrinsic rather than intrinsic properties of concepts to differentiate\\namong classes, instances of those classes will have to migrate often from one class to\\nanother. For example, Chilled wine should not be a class in an ontology describing wine\\nbottles in a restaurant. The property chilled should simply be an attribute of wine in a\\nbottle since an instance of Chilled wine can easily cease being an instance of this class\\nand then become an instance of this class again.\\nUsually numbers, colors, locations are slot values and do not cause the creation of new\\nclasses. Wine, however, is a notable exception since the color of the wine is so paramount to\\nthe description of wine.\\nFor another example, consider the human-anatomy ontology. When we represent ribs, do we\\ncreate a class for each of the “1st left rib”, “2nd left rib”, and so on? Or do we have a class Rib\\nwith slots for the order and the lateral position (left-right)?5 If the information about each of\\nthe ribs that we represent in the ontology is significantly different, then we should indeed\\n                                                5 Here we assume that each anatomical organ is a class since we would also like to talk about “John’s 1st\\nleft rib.” Individual organs of existing people would be represented as individuals in our ontology.18create a class for each of the ribs. That is, if we want to represent details adjacency and\\nlocation information (which is different for each rib) as well as specific functions that each\\nrib playa and organs it protects, we want the classes. If we are modeling anatomy at a slightly\\nlesser level of generality, and all ribs are very similar as far as our potential applications are\\nconcerned (we just talk about which rib is broken on the X-Ray without implications for\\nother parts of the body), we may want to simplify our hierarchy and have just the class Rib,\\nwith two slots: lateral position , order.\\n4.6 An instance or a class?\\nDeciding whether a particular concept is a class in an ontology or an individual instance\\ndepends on what the potential applications of the ontology are. Deciding where classes end\\nand individual instances begin starts with deciding what is the lowest level of granularity in the\\nrepresentation. The level of granularity is in turn determined by a potential application of\\nthe ontology. In other words, what are the most specific items that are going to be\\nrepresented in the knowledge base? Going back to the competency questions we identified in\\nStep 1 in Section 3, the most specific concepts that will constitute answers to those questionsare very good candidates for individuals in the knowledge base.\\nIndividual instances are the most specific concepts represented in a\\nknowledge base.\\nFor example, if we are only going to talk about pairing wine with food we will not be\\ninterested in the specific physical bottles of wine. Therefore, such terms as Sterling\\nVineyards Merlot are probably going to be the most specific terms we use. In other\\nwords, the Wine class is a collection not of individual bottles of wines but rather of the\\nspecific wines produced by specific wineries. Therefore, Sterling Vineyards\\nMerlot would be an instance in the knowledge base.\\nOn the other hand, if we would like to maintain an inventory of wines in the restaurant in\\naddition to the knowledge base of good wine-food pairings, individual bottles of each wine\\nmay become individual instances in our knowledge base.\\nSimilarly, if we would like to record different properties for each specific vintage of the\\nSterling Vineyards Merlot, then the specific vintage of the wine is an instance in\\na knowledge base and Sterling Vineyards Merlot is a class containing instances for\\nall its vintages.\\nAnother rule can “move” some individual instances into the set of classes:\\nIf concepts form a natural hierarchy, then we should represent them as\\nclasses\\nConsider the wine regions. Initially, we may define main wine regions, such as France, United\\nStates, Germany, and so on, as classes and specific wine regions within these large regions as\\ninstances. For example, Bourgogne region is an instance of the French region\\nclass. However, we would also like to say that the Cotes d’Or region is a\\nBourgogne region. Therefore, Bourgogne region must be a class (in order to\\nhave subclasses or instances). However, making Bourgogne region a class and Cotes\\nd’Or region an instance of Bourgogne region seems arbitrary: it is very hard to\\nclearly distinguish which regions are classes and which are instances. Therefore, we define all\\nwine regions as classes. Protégé-2000 allows users to specify some classes as Abstract,\\nsignifying that the class cannot have any direct instances. In our case, all region classes are\\nabstract (Figure 8).19Figure 8. Hierarchy of wine regions. The \"A\" icons next to class names indicate that the classes are\\nabstract and cannot have any direct instances.\\nThe same class hierarchy would be incorrect if we omitted the word “region” from the class\\nnames. We cannot say that the class Alsace is a subclass of the class France: Alsace is\\nnot a kind of France. However, Alsace region is a kind of a French region.\\nOnly classes can be arranged in a hierarchy—knowledge-representation systems do not have a\\nnotion of sub-instance. Therefore, if there is a natural hierarchy among terms, such as in\\nterminological hierarchies from Section 4.2, we should define these terms as classes even\\nthough they may not have any instances of their own.\\n4.7 Limiting the scope\\nAs a final note on defining a class hierarchy, the following set of rules is always helpful in\\ndeciding when an ontology definition is complete:\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible information about the\\ndomain: you do not need to specialize (or generalize) more than you need\\nfor your application (at most one extra level each way).\\nFor our wine and food example, we do not need to know what paper is used for the labels or\\nhow to cook shrimp dishes.\\nSimilarly,\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible properties of and\\ndistinctions among classes in the hierarchy.\\nIn our ontology, we certainly do not include all the properties that a wine or food could have.\\nWe represented the most salient properties of the classes of items in our ontology.  Even\\nthough wine books would tell us the size of grapes, we have not included this knowledge.\\nSimilarly, we have not added all relationships that one could imagine among all the terms in\\nour system.  For example, we do not include relationships such as favorite wine and\\nfavorite food in the ontology just to allow a more complete representation of all of\\nthe interconnections between the terms we have defined.\\nThe last rule also applies to establishing relations among concepts that we have already\\nincluded in the ontology. Consider an ontology describing biology experiments. The ontology\\nwill likely contain a concept of Biological organisms . It will also contain a concept\\nof an Experimenter  performing an experiment (with his name, affiliation, etc.). It is true\\n20that an experimenter, as a person, also happens to be a biological organism. However, we\\nprobably should not incorporate this distinction in the ontology: for the purposes of this\\nrepresentation an experimenter is not a biological organism and we will probably never\\nconduct experiments on the experimenters themselves. If we were representing everything\\nwe can say about the classes in the ontology, an Experimenter  would become a subclass\\nof Biological Organism . However, we do not need to include this knowledge for the\\nforeseeable applications. In fact, including this type of additional classification for existing\\nclasses actually hurts: now an instance of an Experimenter will have slots for weight, age,\\nspecies, and other data pertaining to a  biological organism, but absolutely irrelevant in the\\ncontext of describing an experiment. However, we should record such design decision in the\\ndocumentation for the benefit of the users who will be looking at this ontology and who may\\nnot be aware of the application we had in mind.  Otherwise, people intending to reuse the\\nontology for other applications may try to use experimenter as a subclass of person without\\nknowing that the original modeling did not include that fact.\\n4.8 Disjoint subclasses\\nMany systems allow us to specify explicitly that several classes are disjoint . Classes are\\ndisjoint if they cannot have any instances in common. For example, the Dessert wine\\nand the White wine  classes in our ontology are not disjoint: there are many wines that\\nare instances of both. The Rothermel Trochenbierenauslese Riesling\\ninstance of the Sweet Riesling  class is one such example. At the same time, the Red\\nwine and the White wine classes are disjoint: no wine can be simultaneously red and\\nwhite. Specifying that classes are disjoint enables the system to validate the ontology better.\\nIf we declare the Red wine and the White wine classes to be disjoint and later create a\\nclass that is a subclass of both Riesling  (a subclass of White wine) and Port (a\\nsubclass of Red wine), a system can indicate that there is a modeling error.\\n5 Defining properties—more details\\nIn this section we discuss several more details to keep in mind when defining slots in the\\nontology (Step 5 and Step 6 in Section 3). Mainly, we discuss inverse slots and default values\\nfor a slot.\\n5.1 Inverse slots\\nA value of a slot may depend on a value of another slot. For example, if a wine was\\nproduced by a winery, then the winery produces  that wine. These two relations,\\nmaker and produces , are called inverse relations . Storing the information “in both\\ndirections” is redundant. When we know that a wine is produced by a winery, an application\\nusing the knowledge base can always infer the value for the inverse relation that the winery\\nproduces the wine. However, from the knowledge-acquisition perspective it is convenient to\\nhave both pieces of information explicitly available. This approach allows users to fill in the\\nwine in one case and the winery in another. The knowledge-acquisition system could then\\nautomatically fill in the value for the inverse relation insuring consistency of the knowledge\\nbase.\\nOur example has a pair of inverse slots: the maker slot of the Wine class and the\\nproduces  slot of the Winery class. When a user creates an instance of the Wine class\\nand fills in the value for the maker slot, the system automatically adds the newly created\\ninstance to the produces  slot of the corresponding Winery instance. For instance, when\\nwe say that Sterling Merlot is produced by the Sterling Vineyard winery, the system would21automatically add Sterling Merlot to the list of wines that the Sterling Vineyard winery\\nproduces. (Figure 9).\\nFigure 9. Instances with inverse slots. The slot produces  for the class Winery is an inverse of the\\nslot  maker for the class Wine. Filling in one of the slots triggers an automatic update of the other.\\n5.2 Default values\\nMany frame-based systems allow specification of default values for slots.  If a particular slot\\nvalue is the same for most instances of a class, we can define this value to be a default  value\\nfor the slot. Then, when each new instance of a class containing this slot is created, the\\nsystem fills in the default value automatically. We can then change the value to any other\\nvalue that the facets will allow. That is, default values are there for convenience: they do not\\nenforce any new restrictions on the model or change the model in any way.\\nFor example, if the majority of wines we are going to discuss are full-bodied wines, we can\\nhave “full” as a default value for the body of the wine. Then, unless we say otherwise, all\\nwines we define would be full-bodied.\\nNote that this is different from  slot values . Slot values cannot be changed. For example, we\\ncan say that the slot sugar has value SWEET for the Dessert wine class. Then all the\\nsubclasses and instances of the Dessert wine class will have the SWEET value for the\\nslot sugar. This value cannot be changed in any of the subclasses or instances of the class.\\n6 What’s in a name?\\nDefining naming conventions for concepts in an ontology and then strictly adhering to these\\nconventions not only makes the ontology easier to understand but also helps avoid some\\ncommon modeling mistakes. There are many alternatives in naming concepts. Often there is\\nno particular reason to choose one or another alternative. However, we need to\\nDefine a naming convention for classes and slots and adhere to it.\\nThe following features of a knowledge representation system affect the choice of naming\\n22conventions:\\n• Does the system have the same name space for classes, slots, and instances? That is,\\ndoes the system allow having a class and a slot with the same name (such as a class\\nwinery and a slot winery)?\\n• Is the system case-sensitive? That is, does the system treat the names that differ only\\nin case as different names (such as Winery and winery)?\\n• What delimiters does the system allow in the names? That is, can names contain\\nspaces, commas, asterisks, and so on?\\nProtégé-2000, for example, maintains a single name space for all its frames. It is case-\\nsensitive. Thus, we cannot have a class winery and a slot winery. We can, however, have\\na class Winery (note the upper-case) and a slot winery. CLASSIC, on the other hand, is\\nnot case sensitive and maintains different name spaces for classes, slots, and individuals.\\nThus, from a system perspective, there is no problem in naming both a class and a slot\\nWinery.\\n6.1 Capitalization and delimiters\\nFirst, we can greatly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent\\ncapitalization for concept names. For example, it is common to capitalize class names and\\nuse lower case for slot names (assuming the system is case-sensitive).\\nWhen a concept name contains more than one word (such as Meal course) we need to\\ndelimit the words. Here are some possible choices.\\n• Use Space: Meal course (many systems, including Protégé, allow spaces in\\nconcept names).  \\n• Run the words together and capitalize each new word: MealCourse\\n• Use an underscore or dash or other delimiter in the name: Meal_Course ,\\nMeal_course , Meal-Course , Meal-course . (If you use delimiters, you will\\nalso need to decide whether or not each new word is capitalized)\\nIf the knowledge-representation system allows spaces in names, using them may be the most\\nintuitive solution for many ontology developers. It is however, important to consider other\\nsystems with which your system may interact.  If those systems do not use spaces or if your\\npresentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method.\\n6.2 Singular or plural\\nA class name represents a collection of objects. For example, a class Wine actually\\nrepresents all wines. Therefore, it could be more natural for some designers to call the class\\nWines rather than Wine. No alternative is better or worse than the other (although singular\\nfor class names is used more often in practice). However, whatever the choice, it should be\\nconsistent throughout the whole ontology. Some systems even require their users to declare\\nin advance whether or not they are going to use singular or plural for concept names and do\\nnot allow them to stray from that choice.\\nUsing the same form all the time also prevents a designer from making such modeling\\nmistakes as creating a class Wines and then creating a class Wine as its subclass (see Section\\n4.1).\\n6.3 Prefix and suffix conventions\\nSome knowledge-base methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in the names\\nto distinguish between classes and slots.  Two common practices are to add a has- or a suffix\\n–of to slot names.  Thus, our slots become has-maker  and has-winery  if we chose the23has- convention. The slots become maker-of  and winery-of  if we chose the of-\\nconvention.  This approach allows anyone looking at a term to determine immediately if the\\nterm is a class or a slot.  However, the term names become slightly longer.\\n6.4 Other naming considerations\\nHere are a few more things to consider when defining naming conventions:\\n• Do not add strings such as “class”, “property”, “slot”, and so on to concept names.\\nIt is always clear form the context whether the concept is a class or a slot, for example. In\\naddition is you use different naming conventions for classes and slots (say, capitalization and\\nno capitalization respectively), the name itself would be indicative of what the concept is.\\n• It is usually a good idea to avoid abbreviations in concept names (that is, use\\nCabernet Sauvignon  rather than Cab)\\n• Names of direct subclasses of a class should either all include or not include the name\\nof the superclass. For example, if we are creating two subclasses of the Wine class to\\nrepresent red and white wines, the two subclass names should be either Red Wine\\nand White Wine or Red and White, but not Red Wine and White.\\n7 Other Resources\\nWe have used Protégé-2000 as an ontology-developing environment for our examples.\\nDuineveld and colleagues (Duineveld et al. 2000)  describe and compare a number of other\\nontology-development environments.  \\nWe have tried to address the very basics of ontology development and have not discussed\\nmany of the advanced topics or alternative methodologies for ontology development.\\nGómez-Pérez (Gómez-Pérez 1998)  and Uschold (Uschold and Gruninger 1996)  present\\nalternative ontology-development methodologies. The Ontolingua tutorial (Farquhar 1997)\\ndiscusses some formal aspects of knowledge modeling.   \\nCurrently, researchers emphasize not only ontology development, but also ontology analysis.\\nAs more ontologies are generated and reused, more tools will be available to analyze\\nontologies. For example, Chimaera (McGuinness et al. 2000)  provides diagnostic tools for\\nanalyzing ontologies. The analysis that Chimaera performs includes both a check for logical\\ncorrectness of an ontology and diagnostics of common ontology-design errors. An ontology\\ndesigner may want to run Chimaera diagnostics over the evolving ontology to determine the\\nconformance to common ontology-modeling practices.\\n8 Conclusions\\nIn this guide, we have described an ontology-development methodology for declarative\\nframe-based systems. We listed the steps in the ontology-development process and addressed\\nthe complex issues of defining class hierarchies and properties of classes and instances.\\nHowever, after following all the rules and suggestions, one of the most important things to\\nremember is the following: there is no single correct ontology for any domain . Ontology\\ndesign is a creative process and no two ontologies designed by different people would be the\\nsame. The potential applications of the ontology and the designer’s understanding and view\\nof the domain will undoubtedly affect ontology design choices. “The proof is in the\\npudding”—we can assess the quality of our ontology only by using it in applications for which\\nwe designed it.  24Acknowledgments\\nProtégé-2000 (http://protege.stanford.edu) was developed by Mark Musen’s group at StanfordMedical Informatics.

McGuinness\\nStanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305\\nnoy@smi.stanford.edu   and    dlm@ksl.stanford.edu\\n1 Why develop an ontology?\\nIn recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in\\nthe domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of\\nArtificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have\\nbecome common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large\\ntaxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for\\nsale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is\\ndeveloping the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for\\nencoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching\\nfor information.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in\\nconjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by\\nextending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the\\nWeb (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies\\nthat domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for\\nexample, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED  (Price and\\nSpackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System\\n(Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For\\nexample, the United Nations Development Program and Dun & Bradstreet combined their\\nefforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and\\nservices (www.unspsc.org).\\nAn ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in\\na domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and\\nrelations among them.\\nWhy would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:\\n• To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or\\nsoftware agents\\n• To enable reuse of domain knowledge\\n• To make domain assumptions explicit\\n• To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge\\n• To analyze domain knowledge\\nSharing common understanding of the structure of information among people or software\\nagents  is one of the more common goals in developing ontologies (Musen 1992; Gruber\\n1993). For example, suppose several different Web sites contain medical information or\\nprovide medical e-commerce services. If these Web sites share and publish the same\\nunderlying ontology of the terms they all use, then computer agents can extract and\\naggregate information from these different sites. The agents can use this aggregated\\ninformation to answer user queries or as input data to other applications.\\nEnabling reuse of domain knowledge  was one of the driving forces behind recent surge in\\nontology research. For example, models for many different domains need to represent the\\nnotion of time. This representation includes the notions of time intervals, points in time,\\nrelative measures of time, and so on. If one group of researchers develops such an ontology\\nin detail, others can simply reuse it for their domains. Additionally, if we need to build a large2ontology, we can integrate several existing ontologies describing portions of the large\\ndomain. We can also reuse a general ontology, such as the UNSPSC ontology, and extend it\\nto describe our domain of interest.\\nMaking explicit domain assumptions underlying an implementation makes it possible to\\nchange these assumptions easily if our knowledge about the domain changes. Hard-coding\\nassumptions about the world in programming-language code makes these assumptions not\\nonly hard to find and understand but also hard to change, in particular for someone without\\nprogramming expertise. In addition, explicit specifications of domain knowledge are useful\\nfor new users who must learn what terms in the domain mean.  \\nSeparating the domain knowledge from the operational knowledge is another common use\\nof ontologies. We can describe a task of configuring a product from its components according\\nto a required specification and implement a program that does this configuration independent\\nof the products and components themselves (McGuinness and Wright 1998). We can then\\ndevelop an ontology of PC-components and characteristics and apply the algorithm to\\nconfigure made-to-order PCs. We can also use the same algorithm to configure elevators if\\nwe “feed” an elevator component ontology to it (Rothenfluh et al. 1996).\\nAnalyzing domain knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is\\navailable.  Formal analysis of terms is extremely valuable when both attempting to reuse\\nexisting ontologies and extending them (McGuinness et al. 2000).\\nOften an ontology of the domain is not a goal in itself. Developing an ontology is akin to\\ndefining a set of data and their structure for other programs to use. Problem-solving methods,\\ndomain-independent applications, and software agents use ontologies and knowledge bases\\nbuilt from ontologies as data. For example, in this paper we develop an ontology of wine and\\nfood and appropriate combinations of wine with meals. This ontology can then be used as a\\nbasis for some applications in a suite of restaurant-managing tools: One application could\\ncreate wine suggestions for the menu of the day or answer queries of waiters and customers.\\nAnother application could analyze an inventory list of a wine cellar and suggest which wine\\ncategories to expand and which particular wines to purchase for upcoming menus or\\ncookbooks.\\nAbout this guide\\nWe build on our experience using Protégé-2000 (Protege 2000) , Ontolingua (Ontolingua\\n1997) , and Chimaera (Chimaera 2000)  as ontology-editing environments. In this guide, we\\nuse Protégé-2000 for our examples.\\nThe wine and food example that we use throughout this guide is loosely based on an example\\nknowledge base presented in a paper describing CLASSIC—a knowledge-representation\\nsystem based on a description-logics approach (Brachman et al. 1991) . The CLASSIC tutorial\\n(McGuinness et al. 1994)  has developed this example further. Protégé-2000 and other\\nframe-based systems describe ontologies declaratively, stating explicitly what the class\\nhierarchy is and to which classes individuals belong.\\nSome ontology-design ideas in this guide originated from the literature on object-oriented\\ndesign (Rumbaugh et al. 1991; Booch et al. 1997). However, ontology development is\\ndifferent from designing classes and relations in object-oriented programming. Object-\\noriented programming centers primarily around methods on classes—a programmer makes\\ndesign decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontology designer\\nmakes these decisions based on the structural  properties of a class. As a result, a class\\nstructure and relations among classes in an ontology are different from the structure for a\\nsimilar domain in an object-oriented program.\\nIt is impossible to cover all the issues that an ontology developer may need to grapple with\\nand we are not trying to address all of them in this guide. Instead, we try to provide a starting\\npoint; an initial guide that would help a new ontology designer to develop ontologies. At the3end, we suggest places to look for explanations of more complicated structures and design\\nmechanisms if the domain requires them.\\nFinally, there is no single correct ontology-design methodology and we did not attempt to\\ndefine one. The ideas that we present here are the ones that we found useful in our own\\nontology-development experience. At the end of this guide we suggest a list of references for\\nalternative methodologies.\\n2 What is in an ontology?\\nThe Artificial-Intelligence literature contains many definitions of an ontology; many of\\nthese contradict one another. For the purposes of this guide an ontology  is a formal explicit\\ndescription of concepts in a domain of discourse (classes (sometimes called concepts )),\\nproperties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept (slots\\n(sometimes called  roles or properties )), and restrictions on slots (facets (sometimes called\\nrole restrictions )). An ontology together with a set of individual instances  of classes\\nconstitutes a knowledge base . In reality, there is a fine line where the ontology ends and\\nthe knowledge base begins.\\nClasses are the focus of most ontologies. Classes describe concepts in the domain. For\\nexample, a class of wines represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class. The\\nBordeaux wine in the glass in front of you while you read this document is an instance of the\\nclass of Bordeaux wines. A class can have subclasses  that represent concepts that are more\\nspecific than the superclass. For example, we can divide the class of all wines into red, white,\\nand rosé wines. Alternatively, we can divide a class of all wines into sparkling and non-\\nsparkling wines.  \\nSlots  describe properties of classes and instances: Château Lafite Rothschild\\nPauillac  wine has a full body; it is produced by the Château Lafite Rothschild\\nwinery. We have two slots describing the wine in this example: the slot body with the value\\nfull and the slot maker with the value Château Lafite Rothschild  winery. At the\\nclass level, we can say that instances of the class Wine will have slots describing their\\nflavor, body, sugar level, the maker of the wine and so on.1\\nAll instances of the class Wine, and its subclass Pauillac, have a slot maker the value of\\nwhich is an instance of the class Winery (Figure 1). All instances of the class Winery have a\\nslot produces  that refers to all the wines (instances of the class Wine and its subclasses)\\nthat the winery produces.\\nIn practical terms, developing an ontology includes:\\n• defining classes in the ontology,\\n• arranging the classes in a taxonomic (subclass–superclass) hierarchy,\\n• defining slots and describing allowed values for these slots,\\n• filling in the values for slots for instances.\\nWe can then create a knowledge base by defining individual instances of these classes filling in\\nspecific slot value information and additional slot restrictions.\\n                                                1 We capitalize class names and start slot names with low-case letters. We also use typewriter font  for\\nall terms from the example ontology.4Figure 1.  Some classes, instances, and relations among them in the wine domain.  We used black\\nfor classes and red for instances. Direct links represent slots and internal links such as instance-of\\nand subclass-of.\\n3 A Simple Knowledge-Engineering Methodology\\nAs we said earlier, there is no one “correct” way or methodology for developing ontologies.\\nHere we discuss general issues to consider and offer one possible process for developing an\\nontology. We describe an iterative approach to ontology development: we start with a rough\\nfirst pass at the ontology. We then revise and refine the evolving ontology and fill in the\\ndetails. Along the way, we discuss the modeling decisions that a designer needs to make, as\\nwell as the pros, cons, and implications of different solutions.\\nFirst, we would like to emphasize some fundamental rules in ontology design to which we will\\nrefer many times. These rules may seem rather dogmatic. They can help, however, to make\\ndesign decisions in many cases.\\n1) There is no one correct way to model a domain— there are always\\nviable alternatives. The best solution almost always depends on the\\napplication that you have in mind and the extensions that you anticipate.\\n2) Ontology development is necessarily an iterative process.\\n3) Concepts in the ontology should be close to objects (physical or logical)\\nand relationships in your domain of interest. These are most likely to be\\nnouns (objects) or verbs (relationships) in sentences that describe your\\ndomain.\\nThat is, deciding what we are going to use the ontology for, and how detailed or general the\\nontology is going to be will guide many of the modeling decisions down the road. Among\\nseveral viable alternatives, we will need to determine which one would work better for the\\nprojected task, be more intuitive, more extensible, and more maintainable. We also need to\\nremember that an ontology is a model of reality of the world and the concepts in the\\nontology must reflect this reality. After we define an initial version of the ontology, we can\\nevaluate and debug it by using it in applications or problem-solving methods or by discussing\\nit with experts in the field, or both. As a result, we will almost certainly need to revise the\\ninitial ontology. This process of iterative design will likely continue through the entire\\nlifecycle of the ontology.\\n5Step 1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology\\nWe suggest starting the development of an ontology by defining its domain and scope. That\\nis, answer several basic questions:\\n• What is the domain that the ontology will cover?\\n• For what we are going to use the ontology?\\n• For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?\\n• Who will use and maintain the ontology?\\nThe answers to these questions may change during the ontology-design process, but at any\\ngiven time they help limit the scope of the model.\\nConsider the ontology of wine and food that we introduced earlier. Representation of food\\nand wines is the domain of the ontology. We plan to use this ontology for the applications\\nthat suggest good combinations of wines and food.\\nNaturally, the concepts describing different types of wines, main food types, the notion of a\\ngood combination of wine and food and a bad combination will figure into our ontology. At\\nthe same time, it is unlikely that the ontology will include concepts for managing inventory\\nin a winery or employees in a restaurant even though these concepts are somewhat related to\\nthe notions of wine and food.\\nIf the ontology we are designing will be used to assist in natural language processing of articles\\nin wine magazines, it may be important to include synonyms and part-of-speech information\\nfor concepts in the ontology. If the ontology will be used to help restaurant customers decide\\nwhich wine to order, we need to include retail-pricing information.  If it is used for wine\\nbuyers in stocking a wine cellar, wholesale pricing and availability may be necessary.  If the\\npeople who will maintain the ontology describe the domain in a language that is different\\nfrom the language of the ontology users, we may need to provide the mapping between the\\nlanguages.\\nCompetency questions.\\nOne of the ways to determine the scope of the ontology is to sketch a list of questions that a\\nknowledge base based on the ontology should be able to answer, competency questions\\n(Gruninger and Fox 1995) . These questions will serve as the litmus test later: Does the\\nontology contain enough information to answer these types of questions? Do the answers\\nrequire a particular level of detail or representation of a particular area? These competency\\nquestions are just a sketch and do not need to be exhaustive.\\nIn the wine and food domain, the following are the possible competency questions:\\n• Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?\\n• Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?\\n• Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?\\n• What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?\\n• Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?\\n• Does a bouquet or body of a specific wine change with vintage year?\\n• What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?\\nJudging from this list of questions, the ontology will include the information on various wine\\ncharacteristics and wine types, vintage years—good and bad ones—classifications of foods\\nthat matter for choosing an appropriate wine, recommended combinations of wine and food.\\nStep 2. Consider reusing existing ontologies\\nIt is almost always worth considering what someone else has done and checking if we can\\nrefine and extend existing sources for our particular domain and task. Reusing existing6ontologies may be a requirement if our system needs to interact with other applications that\\nhave already committed to particular ontologies or controlled vocabularies.  Many ontologies\\nare already available in electronic form and can be imported into an ontology-development\\nenvironment that you are using. The formalism in which an ontology is expressed often does\\nnot matter, since many knowledge-representation systems can import and export ontologies.\\nEven if a knowledge-representation system cannot work directly with a particular formalism,\\nthe task of translating an ontology from one formalism to another is usually not a difficult\\none.\\nThere are libraries of reusable ontologies on the Web and in the literature. For example, we\\ncan use the Ontolingua ontology library (http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/software/ontolingua/) orthe DAML ontology library (http://www.daml.org/ontologies/).  There are also a number ofpublicly available commercial ontologies (e.g., UNSPSC (www.unspsc.org), RosettaNet\\n(www.rosettanet.org), DMOZ (www.dmoz.org)).\\nFor example, a knowledge base of French wines may already exist. If we can import this\\nknowledge base and the ontology on which it is based, we will have not only the classification\\nof French wines but also the first pass at the classification of wine characteristics used to\\ndistinguish and describe the wines. Lists of wine properties may already be available from\\ncommercial Web sites such as www.wines.com that customers consider use to buy wines.For this guide however we will assume that no relevant ontologies already exist and start\\ndeveloping the ontology from scratch.\\nStep 3. Enumerate important terms in the ontology\\nIt is useful to write down a list of all terms we would like either to make statements about or\\nto explain to a user. What are the terms we would like to talk about? What properties do\\nthose terms have? What would we like to say about those terms? For example, important\\nwine-related terms will include wine, grape, winery, location , a wine’s color,\\nbody, flavor and sugar content; different types of food, such as fish and red\\nmeat; subtypes of wine such as white wine, and so on. Initially, it is important to get a\\ncomprehensive list of terms without worrying about overlap between concepts they\\nrepresent, relations among the terms, or any properties that the concepts may have, or\\nwhether the concepts are classes or slots.\\nThe next two steps—developing the class hierarchy and defining properties of concepts\\n(slots)—are closely intertwined. It is hard to do one of them first and then do the other.\\nTypically, we create a few definitions of the concepts in the hierarchy and then continue by\\ndescribing properties of these concepts and so on. These two steps are also the most\\nimportant steps in the ontology-design process. We will describe them here briefly and then\\nspend the next two sections discussing the more complicated issues that need to be\\nconsidered, common pitfalls, decisions to make, and so on.\\nStep 4. Define the classes and the class hierarchy\\nThere are several possible approaches in developing a class hierarchy (Uschold and\\nGruninger 1996) :\\n• A top-down  development process starts with the definition of the most general\\nconcepts in the domain and subsequent specialization of the concepts. For example,\\nwe can start with creating classes for the general concepts of Wine and Food. Then\\nwe specialize the Wine class by creating some of its subclasses: White wine, Red\\nwine, Rosé wine. We can further categorize the Red wine class, for example,\\ninto Syrah, Red Burgundy , Cabernet Sauvignon , and so on.7• A bottom-up  development process starts with the definition of the most specific\\nclasses, the leaves of the hierarchy, with subsequent grouping of these classes into\\nmore general concepts. For example, we start by defining classes for Pauillac  and\\nMargaux wines. We then create a common superclass for these two\\nclasses— Medoc—which in turn is a subclass of Bordeaux .\\n• A combination  development process is a combination of the top-down and bottom-\\nup approaches: We define the more salient concepts first and then generalize and\\nspecialize them appropriately. We might start with a few top-level concepts such as\\nWine, and a few specific concepts, such as Margaux . We can then relate them to a\\nmiddle-level concept, such as Medoc.  Then we may want to generate all of the\\nregional wine classes from France, thereby generating a number of middle-level\\nconcepts.\\nFigure 2 shows a possible breakdown among the different levels of generality.\\nFigure 2. The different levels of the Wine taxonomy: Wine is the most general concept.  Red wine,\\nWhite wine,  and Rosé wine are general  top level concepts.   Pauillac  and Margaux are the\\nmost specific classes in the hierarchy (or the bottom level concepts).\\nNone of these three methods is inherently better than any of the others. The approach to\\ntake depends strongly on the personal view of the domain. If a developer has a systematic\\ntop-down view of the domain, then it may be easier to use the top-down approach. The\\ncombination approach is often the easiest for many ontology developers, since the concepts\\n“in the middle” tend to be the more descriptive concepts in the domain (Rosch 1978) .\\nIf you tend to think of wines by distinguishing the most general classification first, then the\\ntop-down approach may work better for you. If you’d rather start by getting grounded with\\nspecific examples, the bottom-up approach may be more appropriate.\\nWhichever approach we choose, we usually start by defining classes. From the list created in\\nStep 3, we select the terms that describe objects having independent existence rather than\\nterms that describe these objects. These terms will be classes in the ontology and will become8anchors in the class hierarchy.2 We organize the classes into a hierarchical taxonomy by\\nasking if by being an instance of one class, the object will necessarily (i.e., by definition) be\\nan instance of some other class.\\nIf a class A is a superclass of class B, then every instance of B is also an\\ninstance of A\\nIn other words, the class B represents a concept that is a “kind of” A.\\nFor example, every Pinot Noir wine is necessarily a red wine. Therefore the Pinot Noir\\nclass is a subclass of the Red Wine class.\\nFigure 2 shows a part of the class hierarchy for the Wine ontology. Section 4 contains a\\ndetailed discussion of things to look for when defining a class hierarchy.\\nFigure 3. The slots for the class Wine and the facets for these slots. The “I” icon next to the maker\\nslot indicates that the slot has an inverse (Section 5.1)\\nStep 5. Define the properties of classes—slots\\nThe classes alone will not provide enough information to answer the competency questions\\nfrom Step 1. Once we have defined some of the classes, we must describe the internal\\nstructure of concepts.\\nWe have already selected classes from the list of terms we created in Step 3. Most of the\\nremaining terms are likely to be properties of these classes. These terms include, for\\nexample, a wine’s color, body, flavor and sugar content and location  of a\\nwinery.\\nFor each property in the list, we must determine which class it describes. These properties\\nbecome slots attached to classes. Thus, the Wine class will have the following slots: color,\\nbody, flavor, and sugar. And the class Winery will have a location slot.\\nIn general, there are several types of object properties that can become slots in an ontology:\\n• “intrinsic” properties such as the flavor of a wine;\\n• “extrinsic” properties such as a wine’s name, and area it comes from;\\n• parts, if the object is structured; these can be both physical and abstract “parts” (e.g.,\\nthe courses of a meal)\\n• relationships to other individuals; these are the relationships between individual\\nmembers of the class and other items (e.g., the maker of a wine, representing a\\nrelationship between a wine and a winery, and the grape the wine is made from.)\\nThus, in addition to the properties we have identified earlier, we need to add the following\\n                                                2 We can also view classes as unary predicates—questions that have one argument.  For example, “Is this\\nobject a wine?”  Unary predicates (or classes) contrast with binary predicates (or slots)—questions that have\\ntwo arguments.  For example, “Is the flavor of this object strong?” “What is the flavor of this object?”\\n9slots to the Wine class: name, area, maker, grape. Figure 3 shows the slots for the class\\nWine.\\nAll subclasses of a class inherit  the slot of that class. For example, all the slots of the class\\nWine will be inherited to all subclasses of Wine, including Red Wine and White Wine.\\nWe will add an additional slot, tannin level (low, moderate, or high), to the Red\\nWine class. The tannin level slot will be inherited by all the classes representing red\\nwines (such as Bordeaux  and Beaujolais ).\\nA slot should be attached at the most general class that can have that property. For instance,\\nbody and color of a wine should be attached at the class Wine, since it is the most general\\nclass whose instances will have body and color.  \\nStep 6. Define the facets of the slots\\nSlots can have different facets describing the value type, allowed values, the number of the\\nvalues (cardinality), and other features of the values the slot can take. For example, the value\\nof a name slot (as in “the name of a wine”) is one string. That is, name is a slot with value\\ntype String. A slot produces  (as in “a winery produces  these wines”) can have multiple\\nvalues and the values are instances of the class Wine. That is, produces  is a slot with value\\ntype Instance  with Wine as allowed class.\\nWe will now describe several common facets.\\nSlot cardinality\\nSlot cardinality defines how many values a slot can have. Some systems distinguish only\\nbetween single cardinality (allowing at most one value) and multiple cardinality (allowing any\\nnumber of values). A body of a wine will be a single cardinality slot (a wine can have only\\none body). Wines produced by a particular winery fill in a multiple-cardinality slot\\nproduces  for a Winery class.\\nSome systems allow specification of a minimum and maximum cardinality to describe the\\nnumber of slot values more precisely. Minimum cardinality of N means that a slot must have\\nat least N values. For example, the grape slot of a Wine has a minimum cardinality of 1:\\neach wine is made of at least one variety of grape. Maximum cardinality of M means that a\\nslot can have at most M values. The maximum cardinality for the grape slot for single\\nvarietal wines is 1: these wines are made from only one variety of grape. Sometimes it may\\nbe useful to set the maximum cardinality to 0. This setting would indicate that the slot\\ncannot have any values for a particular subclass.\\nSlot-value type\\nA value-type facet describes what types of values can fill in the slot. Here is a list of the more\\ncommon value types:\\n• String  is the simplest value type which is used for slots such as name: the value is a\\nsimple string\\n• Number  (sometimes more specific value types of Float and Integer are used)\\ndescribes slots with numeric values. For example, a price of a wine can have a value\\ntype Float\\n• Boolean  slots are simple yes–no flags. For example, if we choose not to represent\\nsparkling wines as a separate class, whether or not a wine is sparkling can be\\nrepresented as a value of a Boolean slot: if the value is “true” (“yes”) the wine is\\nsparkling and if the value is “false” (“no”) the wine is not a sparkling one.\\n• Enumerated slots specify a list of specific allowed values for the slot. For example,\\nwe can specify that the flavor slot can take on one of the three possible values:10strong, moderate , and delicate . In Protégé-2000 the enumerated slots are of\\ntype Symbol.\\n• Instance -type slots allow definition of relationships between individuals. Slots with\\nvalue type Instance must also define a list of allowed classes from which the instances\\ncan come. For example, a slot produces  for the class Winery may have instances\\nof the class Wine as its values.3\\nFigure 4 shows a definition of the slot produces  at the class Winery.\\nFigure 4. The definition of a slot produces  that describes the wines produced by a winery. The\\nslot has cardinality multiple, value type Instance, and the class Wine as the allowed class for its\\nvalues.\\nDomain and range of a slot\\nAllowed classes for slots of type Instance are often called a range  of a slot. In the example\\nin Figure 4 the class Wine is the range of the produces  slot. Some systems allow\\nrestricting the range of a slot when the slot is attached for a particular class.\\nThe classes to which a slot is attached or a classes which property a slot describes, are called\\nthe domain  of the slot. The Winery class is the domain of the produces  slot. In the\\nsystems where we attach  slots to classes, the classes to which the slot is attached usually\\nconstitute the domain of that slot. There is no need to specify the domain separately.\\nThe basic rules for determining a domain and a range of a slot are similar:\\nWhen defining a domain or a range for a slot, find the most general classes\\nor class that can be respectively the domain or the range for the slots .\\nOn the other hand, do not define a domain and range that is overly\\ngeneral: all the classes in the domain of a slot should be described by the\\nslot and instances of all the classes in the range of a slot should be potential\\nfillers for the slot.  Do not choose an overly general class for range (i.e.,\\none would not want to make the range THING) but one would want to\\nchoose a class that will cover all fillers\\nInstead of listing all possible subclasses of the Wine class for the range of the produces\\n                                                3 Some systems just specify value type with a class instead of requiring a special statement of instance\\ntype slots.\\n11slot, just list Wine. At the same time, we do not want to specify the range of the slot as\\nTHING—the most general class in an ontology.\\nIn more specific terms:\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot includes a class\\nand its subclass, remove the subclass.\\nIf the range of the slot contains both the Wine class and the Red Wine class, we can\\nremove the Red Wine from the range because it does not add any new information: The\\nRed Wine is a subclass of Wine and therefore the slot range already implicitly includes it as\\nwell as all other subclasses of the Wine class.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all\\nsubclasses of a class A, but not the class A itself, the range should contain\\nonly the class A and not the subclasses.\\nInstead of defining the range of the slot to include Red Wine, White Wine, and Rose\\nWine (enumerating all the direct subclasses of Wine), we can limit the range to the class\\nWine itself.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all but a\\nfew subclasses of a class A, consider if the class A would make a more\\nappropriate range definition.\\nIn systems where attaching a slot to a class is the same as adding the class to the domain of\\nthe slot, the same rules apply to slot attachment: On the one hand, we should try to make it\\nas general as possible. On the other hand, we must ensure that each class to which we attach\\nthe slot can indeed have the property that the slot represents. We can attach the tannin\\nlevel slot to each of the classes representing red wines (e.g., Bordeaux , Merlot,\\nBeaujolais , etc.). However, since all red wines have the tannin-level property, we should\\ninstead attach the slot to this more general class of Red Wines. Generalizing the domain of\\nthe tannin level slot further (by attaching it to the Wine class instead) would not be\\ncorrect since we do not use tannin level to describe white wines for example.\\nStep 7. Create instances\\nThe last step is creating individual instances of classes in the hierarchy. Defining an individual\\ninstance of a class requires (1) choosing a class, (2) creating an individual instance of that\\nclass, and (3) filling in the slot values. For example, we can create an individual instance\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  to represent a specific type of Beaujolais wine.\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  is an instance of the class Beaujolais  representing\\nall Beaujolais wines. This instance has the following slot values defined (Figure 5):\\n• Body:  Light\\n• Color:  Red\\n• Flavor:  Delicate\\n• Tannin level: Low\\n• Grape:  Gamay (instance of the Wine grape class)\\n• Maker: Chateau-Morgon (instance of the Winery class)\\n• Region:  Beaujolais (instance of the Wine-Region  class)12• Sugar:  Dry\\nFigure 5. The definition of an instance of the Beaujolais  class. The instance is Chateaux\\nMorgon Beaujolais  from the Beaujolais region, produced from the Gamay grape by the\\nChateau Morgon winery. It has a light body, delicate flavor, red color, and low tannin level. It is a\\ndry wine.\\n4 Defining classes and a class hierarchy\\nThis section discusses things to look out for and errors that are easy to make when defining\\nclasses and a class hierarchy (Step 4 from Section 3). As we have mentioned before, there is\\nno single correct class hierarchy for any given domain. The hierarchy depends on the\\npossible uses of the ontology, the level of the detail that is necessary for the application,\\npersonal preferences, and sometimes requirements for compatibility with other models.\\nHowever, we discuss several guidelines to keep in mind when developing a class hierarchy.\\nAfter defining a considerable number of new classes, it is helpful to stand back and check if\\nthe emerging hierarchy conforms to these guidelines.\\n4.1 Ensuring that the class hierarchy is correct\\nAn “is-a” relation\\nThe class hierarchy represents an “is-a” relation: a class A is a subclass of B if every instance\\nof A is also an instance of B. For example, Chardonnay  is a subclass of White wine.\\nAnother way to think of the taxonomic relation is as a “kind-of” relation: Chardonnay  is\\na kind of White wine. A jetliner is a kind of an aircraft. Meat is a kind of food.\\nA subclass of a class represents a concept that is a “kind of” the concept\\nthat the superclass represents.\\nA single wine is not a subclass of all wines\\nA common modeling mistake is to include both a singular and a plural version of the same\\nconcept in the hierarchy making the former a subclass of the latter. For example, it is wrong\\nto define a class Wines and a class Wine as a subclass of Wines. Once you think of the\\nhierarchy as representing the “kind-of” relationship, the modeling error becomes clear: a\\nsingle Wine is not a kind of Wines. The best way to avoid such an error is always to use\\neither singular or plural in naming classes (see Section 6 for the discussion on naming\\n13concepts).\\nTransitivity of the hierarchical relations\\nA subclass relationship is transitive:\\nIf B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, then C is a subclass of A\\nFor example, we can define a class Wine, and then define a class White wine as a subclass\\nof Wine. Then we define a class Chardonnay  as a subclass of White wine. Transitivity\\nof the subclass relationship means that the class Chardonnay is also a subclass of Wine.\\nSometimes we distinguish between direct subclasses and indirect subclasses. A direct subclass\\nis the “closest” subclass of the class: there are no classes between a class and its direct subclass\\nin a hierarchy. That is, there are no other classes in the hierarchy between a class and its\\ndirect superclass. In our example, Chardonnay  is a direct subclass of White wine and is\\nnot a direct subclass of Wine.\\nEvolution of a class hierarchy\\nMaintaining a consistent class hierarchy may become challenging as domains evolve. For\\nexample, for many years, all Zinfandel wines were red. Therefore, we define a class of\\nZinfandel  wines as a subclass of the Red wine class. Sometimes, however, wine makers\\nbegan to press the grapes and to take away the color-producing aspects of the grapes\\nimmediately, thereby modifying the color of the resulting wine. Thus, we get “white\\nzinfandel” whose color is rose. Now we need to break the Zinfandel  class into two classes\\nof zinfandel— White zinfandel  and Red zinfandel —and classify them as\\nsubclasses of Rose wine and Red wine respectively.  \\nClasses and their names\\nIt is important to distinguish between a class and its name:\\nClasses represent concepts in the domain and not the words that denote\\nthese concepts.\\nThe name of a class may change if we choose a different terminology, but the term itself\\nrepresents the objective reality in the world. For example, we may create a class Shrimps,\\nand then rename it to Prawns—the class still represents the same concept. Appropriate\\nwine combinations that referred to shrimp dishes should refer to prawn dishes. In more\\npractical terms, the following rule should always be followed:\\nSynonyms for the same concept do not represent different classes\\nSynonyms are just different names for a concept or a term. Therefore, we should not have a\\nclass called Shrimp and a class called Prawn, and, possibly a class called Crevette .\\nRather, there is one class, named either Shrimp or Prawn. Many systems allow associating\\na list of synonyms, translations, or presentation names with a class. If a system does not\\nallow these associations, synonyms could always be listed in the class documentation.\\nAvoiding class cycles\\nWe should avoid cycles  in the class hierarchy. We say that there is a cycle in a hierarchy\\nwhen some class A has a subclass B and at the same time B is a superclass of A. Creating such\\na cycle in a hierarchy amounts to declaring that the classes A and B are equivalent: all\\ninstances of A are instances of B and all instances of B are also instances of A. Indeed, since\\nB is a subclass of A, all B’s instances must be instances of the class A. Since A is a subclass of\\nB, all A’s instances must also be instances of the class B.144.2 Analyzing siblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings  in the hierarchy are classes that are direct subclasses of the same class (see Section\\n4.1).\\nAll the siblings in the hierarchy (except for the ones at the root) must be at\\nthe same level of generality.\\nFor example, White wine and Chardonnay  should not be subclasses of the same class\\n(say, Wine). White wine is a more general concept than Chardonnay . Siblings should\\nrepresent concepts that fall “along the same line” in the same way that same-level sections\\nin a book are at the same level of generality. In that sense, requirements for a class hierarchy\\nare similar to the requirements for a book outline.\\nThe concepts at the root of the hierarchy however (which are often represented as direct\\nsubclasses of some very general class, such as Thing) represent major divisions of the\\ndomain and do not have to be similar concepts.\\nHow many is too many and how few are too few?\\nThere are no hard rules for the number of direct subclasses that a class should have. However,\\nmany well-structured ontologies have between two and a dozen direct subclasses. Therefore,\\nwe have the following two guidelines:\\nIf a class has only one direct subclass there may be a modeling problem or\\nthe ontology is not complete.\\nIf there are more than a dozen subclasses for a given class then additional\\nintermediate categories may be necessary.\\nThe first of the two rules is similar to a typesetting rule that bulleted lists should never have\\nonly one bullet point. For example, most of the red Burgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines.\\nSuppose we wanted to represent only this majority type of Burgundy wines. We could create a\\nclass Red Burgundy  and then a single subclass Cotes d’Or (Figure 6a). However, if in\\nour representation red Burgundy and Côtes d’Or wines are essentially equivalent (all red\\nBurgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines and all Côtes d’Or wines are red Burgundy wines),\\ncreating the Cotes d’Or class is not necessary and does not add any new information to\\nthe representation. If we were to include Côtes Chalonnaise wines, which are cheaper\\nBurgundy wines from the region just South of Côtes d’Or, then we will create two subclasses\\nof the Burgundy  class: Cotes d’Or and Cotes Chalonnaise  (Figure 6b).\\nFigure 6. Subclasses of the Red Burgundy  class. Having a single subclass of a class usually\\npoints to a problem in modeling.\\nSuppose now that we list all types of wines as direct subclasses of the Wine class. This list\\nwould then include such more general types of wine as Beaujolais and Bordeaux, as well as\\nmore specific types such as Paulliac and Margaux (Figure 6a). The class Wine has too many\\ndirect subclasses and, indeed, for the ontology to reflect the different types of wine in a more\\norganized manner, Medoc should be a subclass of Bordeaux  and Cotes d’Or should be a\\n15subclass of Burgundy . Also having such intermediate categories as Red wine and White\\nwine would also reflect the conceptual model of the domain of wines that many people have\\n(Figure 6b).\\nHowever, if no natural classes exist to group concepts in the long list of siblings, there is no\\nneed to create artificial classes—just leave the classes the way they are. After all, the\\nontology is a reflection of the real world, and if no categorization exists in the real world,\\nthen the ontology should reflect that.\\nFigure 7. Categorizing wines. Having all the wines and types of wine versus having several levels of\\ncategorization.\\n4.3 Multiple inheritance\\nMost knowledge-representation systems allow multiple inheritance  in the class hierarchy:\\na class can be a subclass of several classes. Suppose we would like to create a separate class of\\ndessert wines, the Dessert wine class. The Port wine is both a red wine and a dessert\\n16wine.4 Therefore, we define a class Port to have two superclasses: Red wine and\\nDessert wine. All instances of the Port class will be instances of both the Red wine\\nclass and the Dessert wine class. The Port class will inherit its slots and their facets\\nfrom both its parents. Thus, it will inherit the value SWEET for the slot Sugar from the\\nDessert wine class and the tannin level slot and the value for its color slot from\\nthe Red wine class.\\n4.4 When to introduce a new class (or not)\\nOne of the hardest decisions to make during modeling is when to introduce a new class or\\nwhen to represent a distinction through different property values. It is hard to navigate both\\nan extremely nested hierarchy with many extraneous classes and a very flat hierarchy that\\nhas too few classes with too much information encoded in slots. Finding the appropriate\\nbalance though is not easy.\\nThere are several rules of thumb that help decide when to introduce new classes in a\\nhierarchy.\\nSubclasses of a class usually (1) have additional properties that the\\nsuperclass does not have, or (2) restrictions different from those of the\\nsuperclass, or (3) participate in different relationships than the\\nsuperclasses\\nRed wines can have different levels of tannin, whereas this property is not used to describe\\nwines in general. The value for the sugar slot of the Dessert wine is SWEET, whereas it is not\\ntrue of the superclass of the Dessert Wine class. Pinot Noir wines may go well with seafood\\nwhereas other red wines do not. In other words, we introduce a new class in the hierarchy\\nusually only when there is something that we can say about this class that we cannot say\\nabout the superclass.\\nIn practical terms, each subclass should either have new slots added to it, or have new slot\\nvalues defined, or override some facets for the inherited slots.\\nHowever, sometimes it may be useful to create new classes even if they do not introduce any\\nnew properties.\\nClasses in terminological hierarchies do not have to introduce new\\nproperties\\nFor example, some ontologies include large reference hierarchies of common terms used in\\nthe domain. For example, an ontology underlying an electronic medical-record system may\\ninclude a classification of various diseases. This classification may be just that—a hierarchy\\nof terms, without properties (or with the same set of properties). In that case, it is still useful\\nto organize the terms in a hierarchy rather than a flat list because it will (1) allow easier\\nexploration and navigation and (2) enable a doctor to choose easily a level of generality of\\nthe term that is appropriate for the situation.\\nAnother reason to introduce new classes without any new properties is to model concepts\\namong which domain experts commonly make a distinction even though we may have\\ndecided not to model the distinction itself. Since we use ontologies to facilitate\\ncommunication among domain experts and between domain experts and knowledge-based\\nsystems we would like to reflect the expert’s view of the domain in the ontology.\\nFinally, we should not create subclasses of a class for each additional restriction.  For\\nexample, we introduced the classes Red wine, White wine, and Rose wine  because\\nthis distinction is a natural one in the wine world. We did not introduce classes for delicate\\n                                                4 We chose to represent only red Ports in our ontology: white Ports do exist but they are extremely\\nuncommon.17wine, moderate wine, and so on. When defining a class hierarchy, our goal is to strike a\\nbalance between creating new classes useful for class organization and creating too many\\nclasses.\\n4.5 A new class or a property value?\\nWhen modeling a domain, we often need to decide whether to model a specific distinction\\n(such as white, red, or rosé wine) as a property value or as a set of classes again depends on\\nthe scope of the'"

McGuinness\\nStanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305\\nnoy@smi.stanford.edu   and    dlm@ksl.stanford.edu\\n1 Why develop an ontology?\\nIn recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in\\nthe domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of\\nArtificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have\\nbecome common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large\\ntaxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for\\nsale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is\\ndeveloping the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for\\nencoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching\\nfor information.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in\\nconjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by\\nextending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the\\nWeb (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies\\nthat domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for\\nexample, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED  (Price and\\nSpackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System\\n(Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For\\nexample, the United Nations Development Program and Dun & Bradstreet combined their\\nefforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and\\nservices (www.unspsc.org).\\nAn ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in\\na domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and\\nrelations among them.\\nWhy would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:\\n• To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or\\nsoftware agents\\n• To enable reuse of domain knowledge\\n• To make domain assumptions explicit\\n• To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge\\n• To analyze domain knowledge\\nSharing common understanding of the structure of information among people or software\\nagents  is one of the more common goals in developing ontologies (Musen 1992; Gruber\\n1993). For example, suppose several different Web sites contain medical information or\\nprovide medical e-commerce services. If these Web sites share and publish the same\\nunderlying ontology of the terms they all use, then computer agents can extract and\\naggregate information from these different sites. The agents can use this aggregated\\ninformation to answer user queries or as input data to other applications.\\nEnabling reuse of domain knowledge  was one of the driving forces behind recent surge in\\nontology research. For example, models for many different domains need to represent the\\nnotion of time. This representation includes the notions of time intervals, points in time,\\nrelative measures of time, and so on. If one group of researchers develops such an ontology\\nin detail, others can simply reuse it for their domains. Additionally, if we need to build a large2ontology, we can integrate several existing ontologies describing portions of the large\\ndomain. We can also reuse a general ontology, such as the UNSPSC ontology, and extend it\\nto describe our domain of interest.\\nMaking explicit domain assumptions underlying an implementation makes it possible to\\nchange these assumptions easily if our knowledge about the domain changes. Hard-coding\\nassumptions about the world in programming-language code makes these assumptions not\\nonly hard to find and understand but also hard to change, in particular for someone without\\nprogramming expertise. In addition, explicit specifications of domain knowledge are useful\\nfor new users who must learn what terms in the domain mean.  \\nSeparating the domain knowledge from the operational knowledge is another common use\\nof ontologies. We can describe a task of configuring a product from its components according\\nto a required specification and implement a program that does this configuration independent\\nof the products and components themselves (McGuinness and Wright 1998). We can then\\ndevelop an ontology of PC-components and characteristics and apply the algorithm to\\nconfigure made-to-order PCs. We can also use the same algorithm to configure elevators if\\nwe “feed” an elevator component ontology to it (Rothenfluh et al. 1996).\\nAnalyzing domain knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is\\navailable.  Formal analysis of terms is extremely valuable'),\n",

We can also use the same algorithm to configure elevators if\\nwe “feed” an elevator component ontology to it (Rothenfluh et al. 1996).\\nAnalyzing domain knowledge is possible once a declarative specification of the terms is\\navailable.  Formal analysis of terms is extremely valuable when both attempting to reuse\\nexisting ontologies and extending them (McGuinness et al. 2000).\\nOften an ontology of the domain is not a goal in itself. Developing an ontology is akin to\\ndefining a set of data and their structure for other programs to use. Problem-solving methods,\\ndomain-independent applications, and software agents use ontologies and knowledge bases\\nbuilt from ontologies as data. For example, in this paper we develop an ontology of wine and\\nfood and appropriate combinations of wine with meals. This ontology can then be used as a\\nbasis for some applications in a suite of restaurant-managing tools: One application could\\ncreate wine suggestions for the menu of the day or answer queries of waiters and customers.\\nAnother application could analyze an inventory list of a wine cellar and suggest which wine\\ncategories to expand and which particular wines to purchase for upcoming menus or\\ncookbooks.\\nAbout this guide\\nWe build on our experience using Protégé-2000 (Protege 2000) , Ontolingua (Ontolingua\\n1997) , and Chimaera (Chimaera 2000)  as ontology-editing environments. In this guide, we\\nuse Protégé-2000 for our examples.\\nThe wine and food example that we use throughout this guide is loosely based on an example\\nknowledge base presented in a paper describing CLASSIC—a knowledge-representation\\nsystem based on a description-logics approach (Brachman et al. 1991) . The CLASSIC tutorial\\n(McGuinness et al. 1994)  has developed this example further. Protégé-2000 and other\\nframe-based systems describe ontologies declaratively, stating explicitly what the class\\nhierarchy is and to which classes individuals belong.\\nSome ontology-design ideas in this guide originated from the literature on object-oriented\\ndesign (Rumbaugh et al. 1991; Booch et al. 1997). However, ontology development is\\ndifferent from designing classes and relations in object-oriented programming. Object-\\noriented programming centers primarily around methods on classes—a programmer makes\\ndesign decisions based on the operational properties of a class, whereas an ontology designer\\nmakes these decisions based on the structural  properties of a class. As a result, a class\\nstructure and relations among classes in an ontology are different from the structure for a\\nsimilar domain in an object-oriented program.\\nIt is impossible to cover all the issues that an ontology developer may need to grapple with\\nand we are not trying to address all of them in this guide. Instead, we try to provide a starting\\npoint; an initial guide that would help a new ontology designer to develop ontologies. At the3end, we suggest places to look for explanations of more complicated structures and design\\nmechanisms if the domain requires them.\\nFinally, there is no single correct ontology-design methodology and we did not attempt to\\ndefine one. The ideas that we present here are the ones that we found useful in our own\\nontology-development experience. At the end of this guide we suggest a list of references for\\nalternative methodologies.\\n2 What is in an ontology?\\nThe Artificial-Intelligence literature contains many definitions of an ontology; many of\\nthese contradict one another. For the purposes of this guide an ontology  is a formal explicit\\ndescription of concepts in a domain of discourse (classes (sometimes called concepts )),\\nproperties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept (slots\\n(sometimes called  roles or properties )), and restrictions on slots (facets (sometimes called\\nrole restrictions )). An ontology together with a set of individual instances  of classes\\nconstitutes a knowledge base . In reality, there is a fine line where the ontology ends and\\nthe knowledge base begins.\\nClasses are the focus of most ontologies. Classes describe concepts in the domain. For\\nexample, a class of wines represents all wines. Specific wines are instances of this class. The\\nBordeaux wine in the glass in front of you while you read this document is an instance of the\\nclass of Bordeaux wines. A class can have subclasses  that represent concepts that are more\\nspecific than the superclass. For example, we can divide the class of all wines into red, white,\\nand rosé wines. Alternatively, we can divide a class of all wines into sparkling and non-\\nsparkling wines.  \\nSlots  describe properties'),\n",

Alternatively, we can divide a class of all wines into sparkling and non-\\nsparkling wines.  \\nSlots  describe properties of classes and instances: Château Lafite Rothschild\\nPauillac  wine has a full body; it is produced by the Château Lafite Rothschild\\nwinery. We have two slots describing the wine in this example: the slot body with the value\\nfull and the slot maker with the value Château Lafite Rothschild  winery. At the\\nclass level, we can say that instances of the class Wine will have slots describing their\\nflavor, body, sugar level, the maker of the wine and so on.1\\nAll instances of the class Wine, and its subclass Pauillac, have a slot maker the value of\\nwhich is an instance of the class Winery (Figure 1). All instances of the class Winery have a\\nslot produces  that refers to all the wines (instances of the class Wine and its subclasses)\\nthat the winery produces.\\nIn practical terms, developing an ontology includes:\\n• defining classes in the ontology,\\n• arranging the classes in a taxonomic (subclass–superclass) hierarchy,\\n• defining slots and describing allowed values for these slots,\\n• filling in the values for slots for instances.\\nWe can then create a knowledge base by defining individual instances of these classes filling in\\nspecific slot value information and additional slot restrictions.\\n                                                1 We capitalize class names and start slot names with low-case letters. We also use typewriter font  for\\nall terms from the example ontology.4Figure 1.  Some classes, instances, and relations among them in the wine domain.  We used black\\nfor classes and red for instances. Direct links represent slots and internal links such as instance-of\\nand subclass-of.\\n3 A Simple Knowledge-Engineering Methodology\\nAs we said earlier, there is no one “correct” way or methodology for developing ontologies.\\nHere we discuss general issues to consider and offer one possible process for developing an\\nontology. We describe an iterative approach to ontology development: we start with a rough\\nfirst pass at the ontology. We then revise and refine the evolving ontology and fill in the\\ndetails. Along the way, we discuss the modeling decisions that a designer needs to make, as\\nwell as the pros, cons, and implications of different solutions.\\nFirst, we would like to emphasize some fundamental rules in ontology design to which we will\\nrefer many times. These rules may seem rather dogmatic. They can help, however, to make\\ndesign decisions in many cases.\\n1) There is no one correct way to model a domain— there are always\\nviable alternatives. The best solution almost always depends on the\\napplication that you have in mind and the extensions that you anticipate.\\n2) Ontology development is necessarily an iterative process.\\n3) Concepts in the ontology should be close to objects (physical or logical)\\nand relationships in your domain of interest. These are most likely to be\\nnouns (objects) or verbs (relationships) in sentences that describe your\\ndomain.\\nThat is, deciding what we are going to use the ontology for, and how detailed or general the\\nontology is going to be will guide many of the modeling decisions down the road. Among\\nseveral viable alternatives, we will need to determine which one would work better for the\\nprojected task, be more intuitive, more extensible, and more maintainable. We also need to\\nremember that an ontology is a model of reality of the world and the concepts in the\\nontology must reflect this reality. After we define an initial version of the ontology, we can\\nevaluate and debug it by using it in applications or problem-solving methods or by discussing\\nit with experts in the field, or both. As a result, we will almost certainly need to revise the\\ninitial ontology. This process of iterative design will likely continue through the entire\\nlifecycle of the ontology.\\n5Step 1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology\\nWe suggest starting the development of an ontology by defining its domain and scope. That\\nis, answer several basic questions:\\n• What is the domain that the ontology will cover?\\n• For what we are going to use the ontology?\\n• For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?\\n• Who will use and maintain the ontology?\\nThe answers to these questions may change during the ontology-design process, but at any\\ngiven time they help limit the scope of the model.\\nConsider the ontology'),\n",

That\\nis, answer several basic questions:\\n• What is the domain that the ontology will cover?\\n• For what we are going to use the ontology?\\n• For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?\\n• Who will use and maintain the ontology?\\nThe answers to these questions may change during the ontology-design process, but at any\\ngiven time they help limit the scope of the model.\\nConsider the ontology of wine and food that we introduced earlier. Representation of food\\nand wines is the domain of the ontology. We plan to use this ontology for the applications\\nthat suggest good combinations of wines and food.\\nNaturally, the concepts describing different types of wines, main food types, the notion of a\\ngood combination of wine and food and a bad combination will figure into our ontology. At\\nthe same time, it is unlikely that the ontology will include concepts for managing inventory\\nin a winery or employees in a restaurant even though these concepts are somewhat related to\\nthe notions of wine and food.\\nIf the ontology we are designing will be used to assist in natural language processing of articles\\nin wine magazines, it may be important to include synonyms and part-of-speech information\\nfor concepts in the ontology. If the ontology will be used to help restaurant customers decide\\nwhich wine to order, we need to include retail-pricing information.  If it is used for wine\\nbuyers in stocking a wine cellar, wholesale pricing and availability may be necessary.  If the\\npeople who will maintain the ontology describe the domain in a language that is different\\nfrom the language of the ontology users, we may need to provide the mapping between the\\nlanguages.\\nCompetency questions.\\nOne of the ways to determine the scope of the ontology is to sketch a list of questions that a\\nknowledge base based on the ontology should be able to answer, competency questions\\n(Gruninger and Fox 1995) . These questions will serve as the litmus test later: Does the\\nontology contain enough information to answer these types of questions? Do the answers\\nrequire a particular level of detail or representation of a particular area? These competency\\nquestions are just a sketch and do not need to be exhaustive.\\nIn the wine and food domain, the following are the possible competency questions:\\n• Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?\\n• Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?\\n• Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?\\n• What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?\\n• Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?\\n• Does a bouquet or body of a specific wine change with vintage year?\\n• What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel?\\nJudging from this list of questions, the ontology will include the information on various wine\\ncharacteristics and wine types, vintage years—good and bad ones—classifications of foods\\nthat matter for choosing an appropriate wine, recommended combinations of wine and food.\\nStep 2. Consider reusing existing ontologies\\nIt is almost always worth considering what someone else has done and checking if we can\\nrefine and extend existing sources for our particular domain and task. Reusing existing6ontologies may be a requirement if our system needs to interact with other applications that\\nhave already committed to particular ontologies or controlled vocabularies.  Many ontologies\\nare already available in electronic form and can be imported into an ontology-development\\nenvironment that you are using. The formalism in which an ontology is expressed often does\\nnot matter, since many knowledge-representation systems can import and export ontologies.\\nEven if a knowledge-representation system cannot work directly with a particular formalism,\\nthe task of translating an ontology from one formalism to another is usually not a difficult\\none.\\nThere are libraries of reusable ontologies on the Web and in the literature. For example, we\\ncan use the Ontolingua ontology library (http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/software/ontolingua/) orthe DAML ontology library (http://www.daml.org/ontologies/).  There are also a number ofpublicly available commercial ontologies (e.g., UNSPSC (www.unspsc.org), RosettaNet\\n(www.rosettanet.org), DMOZ (www.dmoz.org)).\\nFor example, a knowledge base of French wines may already exist. If we can import this\\nknowledge base and the ontology on which it is based, we will have not only the classification\\nof French wines but also the first pass at the classification of wine characteristics used to\\ndistinguish and describe the wines. Lists of wine properties may already be available from\\ncommercial Web sites such as www.wines.com that customers consider use to buy wines.For this guide however we will assume that no relevant ontologies already exist and start\\ndeveloping the'),\n",

Lists of wine properties may already be available from\\ncommercial Web sites such as www.wines.com that customers consider use to buy wines.For this guide however we will assume that no relevant ontologies already exist and start\\ndeveloping the ontology from scratch.\\nStep 3. Enumerate important terms in the ontology\\nIt is useful to write down a list of all terms we would like either to make statements about or\\nto explain to a user. What are the terms we would like to talk about? What properties do\\nthose terms have? What would we like to say about those terms? For example, important\\nwine-related terms will include wine, grape, winery, location , a wine’s color,\\nbody, flavor and sugar content; different types of food, such as fish and red\\nmeat; subtypes of wine such as white wine, and so on. Initially, it is important to get a\\ncomprehensive list of terms without worrying about overlap between concepts they\\nrepresent, relations among the terms, or any properties that the concepts may have, or\\nwhether the concepts are classes or slots.\\nThe next two steps—developing the class hierarchy and defining properties of concepts\\n(slots)—are closely intertwined. It is hard to do one of them first and then do the other.\\nTypically, we create a few definitions of the concepts in the hierarchy and then continue by\\ndescribing properties of these concepts and so on. These two steps are also the most\\nimportant steps in the ontology-design process. We will describe them here briefly and then\\nspend the next two sections discussing the more complicated issues that need to be\\nconsidered, common pitfalls, decisions to make, and so on.\\nStep 4. Define the classes and the class hierarchy\\nThere are several possible approaches in developing a class hierarchy (Uschold and\\nGruninger 1996) :\\n• A top-down  development process starts with the definition of the most general\\nconcepts in the domain and subsequent specialization of the concepts. For example,\\nwe can start with creating classes for the general concepts of Wine and Food. Then\\nwe specialize the Wine class by creating some of its subclasses: White wine, Red\\nwine, Rosé wine. We can further categorize the Red wine class, for example,\\ninto Syrah, Red Burgundy , Cabernet Sauvignon , and so on.7• A bottom-up  development process starts with the definition of the most specific\\nclasses, the leaves of the hierarchy, with subsequent grouping of these classes into\\nmore general concepts. For example, we start by defining classes for Pauillac  and\\nMargaux wines. We then create a common superclass for these two\\nclasses— Medoc—which in turn is a subclass of Bordeaux .\\n• A combination  development process is a combination of the top-down and bottom-\\nup approaches: We define the more salient concepts first and then generalize and\\nspecialize them appropriately. We might start with a few top-level concepts such as\\nWine, and a few specific concepts, such as Margaux . We can then relate them to a\\nmiddle-level concept, such as Medoc.  Then we may want to generate all of the\\nregional wine classes from France, thereby generating a number of middle-level\\nconcepts.\\nFigure 2 shows a possible breakdown among the different levels of generality.\\nFigure 2. The different levels of the Wine taxonomy: Wine is the most general concept.  Red wine,\\nWhite wine,  and Rosé wine are general  top level concepts.   Pauillac  and Margaux are the\\nmost specific classes in the hierarchy (or the bottom level concepts).\\nNone of these three methods is inherently better than any of the others. The approach to\\ntake depends strongly on the personal view of the domain. If a developer has a systematic\\ntop-down view of the domain, then it may be easier to use the top-down approach. The\\ncombination approach is often the easiest for many ontology developers, since the concepts\\n“in the middle” tend to be the more descriptive concepts in the domain (Rosch 1978) .\\nIf you tend to think of wines by distinguishing the most general classification first, then the\\ntop-down approach may work better for you. If you’d rather start by getting grounded with\\nspecific examples, the bottom-up approach may be more appropriate.\\nWhichever approach we choose, we usually start by defining classes. From the list created in\\nStep 3, we select the terms that describe objects having independent existence rather than\\nterms that describe these objects. These terms will be classes in the ontology and will become'),\n",

From the list created in\\nStep 3, we select the terms that describe objects having independent existence rather than\\nterms that describe these objects. These terms will be classes in the ontology and will become8anchors in the class hierarchy.2 We organize the classes into a hierarchical taxonomy by\\nasking if by being an instance of one class, the object will necessarily (i.e., by definition) be\\nan instance of some other class.\\nIf a class A is a superclass of class B, then every instance of B is also an\\ninstance of A\\nIn other words, the class B represents a concept that is a “kind of” A.\\nFor example, every Pinot Noir wine is necessarily a red wine. Therefore the Pinot Noir\\nclass is a subclass of the Red Wine class.\\nFigure 2 shows a part of the class hierarchy for the Wine ontology. Section 4 contains a\\ndetailed discussion of things to look for when defining a class hierarchy.\\nFigure 3. The slots for the class Wine and the facets for these slots. The “I” icon next to the maker\\nslot indicates that the slot has an inverse (Section 5.1)\\nStep 5. Define the properties of classes—slots\\nThe classes alone will not provide enough information to answer the competency questions\\nfrom Step 1. Once we have defined some of the classes, we must describe the internal\\nstructure of concepts.\\nWe have already selected classes from the list of terms we created in Step 3. Most of the\\nremaining terms are likely to be properties of these classes. These terms include, for\\nexample, a wine’s color, body, flavor and sugar content and location  of a\\nwinery.\\nFor each property in the list, we must determine which class it describes. These properties\\nbecome slots attached to classes. Thus, the Wine class will have the following slots: color,\\nbody, flavor, and sugar. And the class Winery will have a location slot.\\nIn general, there are several types of object properties that can become slots in an ontology:\\n• “intrinsic” properties such as the flavor of a wine;\\n• “extrinsic” properties such as a wine’s name, and area it comes from;\\n• parts, if the object is structured; these can be both physical and abstract “parts” (e.g.,\\nthe courses of a meal)\\n• relationships to other individuals; these are the relationships between individual\\nmembers of the class and other items (e.g., the maker of a wine, representing a\\nrelationship between a wine and a winery, and the grape the wine is made from.)\\nThus, in addition to the properties we have identified earlier, we need to add the following\\n                                                2 We can also view classes as unary predicates—questions that have one argument.  For example, “Is this\\nobject a wine?”  Unary predicates (or classes) contrast with binary predicates (or slots)—questions that have\\ntwo arguments.  For example, “Is the flavor of this object strong?” “What is the flavor of this object?”\\n9slots to the Wine class: name, area, maker, grape. Figure 3 shows the slots for the class\\nWine.\\nAll subclasses of a class inherit  the slot of that class. For example, all the slots of the class\\nWine will be inherited to all subclasses of Wine, including Red Wine and White Wine.\\nWe will add an additional slot, tannin level (low, moderate, or high), to the Red\\nWine class. The tannin level slot will be inherited by all the classes representing red\\nwines (such as Bordeaux  and Beaujolais ).\\nA slot should be attached at the most general class that can have that property. For instance,\\nbody and color of a wine should be attached at the class Wine, since it is the most general\\nclass whose instances will have body and color.  \\nStep 6. Define the facets of the slots\\nSlots can have different facets describing the value type, allowed values, the number of the\\nvalues (cardinality), and other features of the values the slot can take. For example, the value\\nof a name slot (as in “the name of a wine”) is one string. That is, name is a slot with value\\ntype String. A slot produces  (as in “a winery produces  these wines”) can have multiple\\nvalues and the values are instances of the class Wine. That is, produces  is a slot with value\\ntype Instance  with Wine as allowed class.\\nWe will now'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' features of the values the slot can take. For example, the value\\nof a name slot (as in “the name of a wine”) is one string. That is, name is a slot with value\\ntype String. A slot produces  (as in “a winery produces  these wines”) can have multiple\\nvalues and the values are instances of the class Wine. That is, produces  is a slot with value\\ntype Instance  with Wine as allowed class.\\nWe will now describe several common facets.\\nSlot cardinality\\nSlot cardinality defines how many values a slot can have. Some systems distinguish only\\nbetween single cardinality (allowing at most one value) and multiple cardinality (allowing any\\nnumber of values). A body of a wine will be a single cardinality slot (a wine can have only\\none body). Wines produced by a particular winery fill in a multiple-cardinality slot\\nproduces  for a Winery class.\\nSome systems allow specification of a minimum and maximum cardinality to describe the\\nnumber of slot values more precisely. Minimum cardinality of N means that a slot must have\\nat least N values. For example, the grape slot of a Wine has a minimum cardinality of 1:\\neach wine is made of at least one variety of grape. Maximum cardinality of M means that a\\nslot can have at most M values. The maximum cardinality for the grape slot for single\\nvarietal wines is 1: these wines are made from only one variety of grape. Sometimes it may\\nbe useful to set the maximum cardinality to 0. This setting would indicate that the slot\\ncannot have any values for a particular subclass.\\nSlot-value type\\nA value-type facet describes what types of values can fill in the slot. Here is a list of the more\\ncommon value types:\\n• String  is the simplest value type which is used for slots such as name: the value is a\\nsimple string\\n• Number  (sometimes more specific value types of Float and Integer are used)\\ndescribes slots with numeric values. For example, a price of a wine can have a value\\ntype Float\\n• Boolean  slots are simple yes–no flags. For example, if we choose not to represent\\nsparkling wines as a separate class, whether or not a wine is sparkling can be\\nrepresented as a value of a Boolean slot: if the value is “true” (“yes”) the wine is\\nsparkling and if the value is “false” (“no”) the wine is not a sparkling one.\\n• Enumerated slots specify a list of specific allowed values for the slot. For example,\\nwe can specify that the flavor slot can take on one of the three possible values:10strong, moderate , and delicate . In Protégé-2000 the enumerated slots are of\\ntype Symbol.\\n• Instance -type slots allow definition of relationships between individuals. Slots with\\nvalue type Instance must also define a list of allowed classes from which the instances\\ncan come. For example, a slot produces  for the class Winery may have instances\\nof the class Wine as its values.3\\nFigure 4 shows a definition of the slot produces  at the class Winery.\\nFigure 4. The definition of a slot produces  that describes the wines produced by a winery. The\\nslot has cardinality multiple, value type Instance, and the class Wine as the allowed class for its\\nvalues.\\nDomain and range of a slot\\nAllowed classes for slots of type Instance are often called a range  of a slot. In the example\\nin Figure 4 the class Wine is the range of the produces  slot. Some systems allow\\nrestricting the range of a slot when the slot is attached for a particular class.\\nThe classes to which a slot is attached or a classes which property a slot describes, are called\\nthe domain  of the slot. The Winery class is the domain of the produces  slot. In the\\nsystems where we attach  slots to classes, the classes to which the slot is attached usually\\nconstitute the domain of that slot. There is no need to specify the domain separately.\\nThe basic rules for determining a domain and a range of a slot are similar:\\nWhen defining a domain or a range for a slot, find the most general classes\\nor class that can be respectively the domain or the range for the slots .\\nOn the other hand, do not define a domain and range that is overly\\ngeneral: all the classes in the domain of a slot should be described by the\\nslot and instances of all the classes in the range of a slot should be potential\\nfillers for the slot.  Do not choose an overly general class for range (i.e.,\\none would not want to make the range THING) but one would want to\\nchoose a class that will cover all fillers\\nInstead'),\n",

At the same time, we do not want to specify the range of the slot as\\nTHING—the most general class in an ontology.\\nIn more specific terms:\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot includes a class\\nand its subclass, remove the subclass.\\nIf the range of the slot contains both the Wine class and the Red Wine class, we can\\nremove the Red Wine from the range because it does not add any new information: The\\nRed Wine is a subclass of Wine and therefore the slot range already implicitly includes it as\\nwell as all other subclasses of the Wine class.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all\\nsubclasses of a class A, but not the class A itself, the range should contain\\nonly the class A and not the subclasses.\\nInstead of defining the range of the slot to include Red Wine, White Wine, and Rose\\nWine (enumerating all the direct subclasses of Wine), we can limit the range to the class\\nWine itself.\\nIf a list of classes defining a range or a  domain of a slot contains all but a\\nfew subclasses of a class A, consider if the class A would make a more\\nappropriate range definition.\\nIn systems where attaching a slot to a class is the same as adding the class to the domain of\\nthe slot, the same rules apply to slot attachment: On the one hand, we should try to make it\\nas general as possible. On the other hand, we must ensure that each class to which we attach\\nthe slot can indeed have the property that the slot represents. We can attach the tannin\\nlevel slot to each of the classes representing red wines (e.g., Bordeaux , Merlot,\\nBeaujolais , etc.). However, since all red wines have the tannin-level property, we should\\ninstead attach the slot to this more general class of Red Wines. Generalizing the domain of\\nthe tannin level slot further (by attaching it to the Wine class instead) would not be\\ncorrect since we do not use tannin level to describe white wines for example.\\nStep 7. Create instances\\nThe last step is creating individual instances of classes in the hierarchy. Defining an individual\\ninstance of a class requires (1) choosing a class, (2) creating an individual instance of that\\nclass, and (3) filling in the slot values. For example, we can create an individual instance\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  to represent a specific type of Beaujolais wine.\\nChateau-Morgon-Beaujolais  is an instance of the class Beaujolais  representing\\nall Beaujolais wines. This instance has the following slot values defined (Figure 5):\\n• Body:  Light\\n• Color:  Red\\n• Flavor:  Delicate\\n• Tannin level: Low\\n• Grape:  Gamay (instance of the Wine grape class)\\n• Maker: Chateau-Morgon (instance of the Winery class)\\n• Region:  Beaujolais (instance of the Wine-Region  class)12• Sugar:  Dry\\nFigure 5. The definition of an instance of the Beaujolais  class. The instance is Chateaux\\nMorgon Beaujolais  from the Beaujolais region, produced from the Gamay grape by the\\nChateau Morgon winery. It has a light body, delicate flavor, red color, and low tannin level. It is a\\ndry wine.\\n4 Defining classes and a class hierarchy\\nThis section discusses things to look out for and errors that are easy to make when defining\\nclasses and a class hierarchy (Step 4 from Section 3). As we have mentioned before, there is\\nno single correct class hierarchy for any given domain. The hierarchy depends on the\\npossible uses of the ontology, the level of the detail that is necessary for the application,\\npersonal preferences, and sometimes requirements for compatibility with other models.\\nHowever, we discuss several guidelines to keep in mind when'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' hierarchy\\nThis section discusses things to look out for and errors that are easy to make when defining\\nclasses and a class hierarchy (Step 4 from Section 3). As we have mentioned before, there is\\nno single correct class hierarchy for any given domain. The hierarchy depends on the\\npossible uses of the ontology, the level of the detail that is necessary for the application,\\npersonal preferences, and sometimes requirements for compatibility with other models.\\nHowever, we discuss several guidelines to keep in mind when developing a class hierarchy.\\nAfter defining a considerable number of new classes, it is helpful to stand back and check if\\nthe emerging hierarchy conforms to these guidelines.\\n4.1 Ensuring that the class hierarchy is correct\\nAn “is-a” relation\\nThe class hierarchy represents an “is-a” relation: a class A is a subclass of B if every instance\\nof A is also an instance of B. For example, Chardonnay  is a subclass of White wine.\\nAnother way to think of the taxonomic relation is as a “kind-of” relation: Chardonnay  is\\na kind of White wine. A jetliner is a kind of an aircraft. Meat is a kind of food.\\nA subclass of a class represents a concept that is a “kind of” the concept\\nthat the superclass represents.\\nA single wine is not a subclass of all wines\\nA common modeling mistake is to include both a singular and a plural version of the same\\nconcept in the hierarchy making the former a subclass of the latter. For example, it is wrong\\nto define a class Wines and a class Wine as a subclass of Wines. Once you think of the\\nhierarchy as representing the “kind-of” relationship, the modeling error becomes clear: a\\nsingle Wine is not a kind of Wines. The best way to avoid such an error is always to use\\neither singular or plural in naming classes (see Section 6 for the discussion on naming\\n13concepts).\\nTransitivity of the hierarchical relations\\nA subclass relationship is transitive:\\nIf B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, then C is a subclass of A\\nFor example, we can define a class Wine, and then define a class White wine as a subclass\\nof Wine. Then we define a class Chardonnay  as a subclass of White wine. Transitivity\\nof the subclass relationship means that the class Chardonnay is also a subclass of Wine.\\nSometimes we distinguish between direct subclasses and indirect subclasses. A direct subclass\\nis the “closest” subclass of the class: there are no classes between a class and its direct subclass\\nin a hierarchy. That is, there are no other classes in the hierarchy between a class and its\\ndirect superclass. In our example, Chardonnay  is a direct subclass of White wine and is\\nnot a direct subclass of Wine.\\nEvolution of a class hierarchy\\nMaintaining a consistent class hierarchy may become challenging as domains evolve. For\\nexample, for many years, all Zinfandel wines were red. Therefore, we define a class of\\nZinfandel  wines as a subclass of the Red wine class. Sometimes, however, wine makers\\nbegan to press the grapes and to take away the color-producing aspects of the grapes\\nimmediately, thereby modifying the color of the resulting wine. Thus, we get “white\\nzinfandel” whose color is rose. Now we need to break the Zinfandel  class into two classes\\nof zinfandel— White zinfandel  and Red zinfandel —and classify them as\\nsubclasses of Rose wine and Red wine respectively.  \\nClasses and their names\\nIt is important to distinguish between a class and its name:\\nClasses represent concepts in the domain and not the words that denote\\nthese concepts.\\nThe name of a class may change if we choose a different terminology, but the term itself\\nrepresents the objective reality in the world. For example, we may create a class Shrimps,\\nand then rename it to Prawns—the class still represents the same concept. Appropriate\\nwine combinations that referred to shrimp dishes should refer to prawn dishes. In more\\npractical terms, the following rule should always be followed:\\nSynonyms for the same concept do not represent different classes\\nSynonyms are just different names for a concept or a term. Therefore, we should not have a\\nclass called Shrimp and a class called Prawn, and, possibly a class called Crevette .\\nRather, there is one class, named either Shrimp or Prawn. Many systems allow associating\\na list of synonyms, translations, or presentation names with a class. If a system does not\\nallow these associations, synonyms could always be listed in the class documentation.\\nAvoiding class cycles\\nWe should avoid cycles  in the class hierarchy. We say that there is a'),\n",

Many systems allow associating\\na list of synonyms, translations, or presentation names with a class. If a system does not\\nallow these associations, synonyms could always be listed in the class documentation.\\nAvoiding class cycles\\nWe should avoid cycles  in the class hierarchy. We say that there is a cycle in a hierarchy\\nwhen some class A has a subclass B and at the same time B is a superclass of A. Creating such\\na cycle in a hierarchy amounts to declaring that the classes A and B are equivalent: all\\ninstances of A are instances of B and all instances of B are also instances of A. Indeed, since\\nB is a subclass of A, all B’s instances must be instances of the class A. Since A is a subclass of\\nB, all A’s instances must also be instances of the class B.144.2 Analyzing siblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings in a class hierarchy\\nSiblings  in the hierarchy are classes that are direct subclasses of the same class (see Section\\n4.1).\\nAll the siblings in the hierarchy (except for the ones at the root) must be at\\nthe same level of generality.\\nFor example, White wine and Chardonnay  should not be subclasses of the same class\\n(say, Wine). White wine is a more general concept than Chardonnay . Siblings should\\nrepresent concepts that fall “along the same line” in the same way that same-level sections\\nin a book are at the same level of generality. In that sense, requirements for a class hierarchy\\nare similar to the requirements for a book outline.\\nThe concepts at the root of the hierarchy however (which are often represented as direct\\nsubclasses of some very general class, such as Thing) represent major divisions of the\\ndomain and do not have to be similar concepts.\\nHow many is too many and how few are too few?\\nThere are no hard rules for the number of direct subclasses that a class should have. However,\\nmany well-structured ontologies have between two and a dozen direct subclasses. Therefore,\\nwe have the following two guidelines:\\nIf a class has only one direct subclass there may be a modeling problem or\\nthe ontology is not complete.\\nIf there are more than a dozen subclasses for a given class then additional\\nintermediate categories may be necessary.\\nThe first of the two rules is similar to a typesetting rule that bulleted lists should never have\\nonly one bullet point. For example, most of the red Burgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines.\\nSuppose we wanted to represent only this majority type of Burgundy wines. We could create a\\nclass Red Burgundy  and then a single subclass Cotes d’Or (Figure 6a). However, if in\\nour representation red Burgundy and Côtes d’Or wines are essentially equivalent (all red\\nBurgundy wines are Côtes d’Or wines and all Côtes d’Or wines are red Burgundy wines),\\ncreating the Cotes d’Or class is not necessary and does not add any new information to\\nthe representation. If we were to include Côtes Chalonnaise wines, which are cheaper\\nBurgundy wines from the region just South of Côtes d’Or, then we will create two subclasses\\nof the Burgundy  class: Cotes d’Or and Cotes Chalonnaise  (Figure 6b).\\nFigure 6. Subclasses of the Red Burgundy  class. Having a single subclass of a class usually\\npoints to a problem in modeling.\\nSuppose now that we list all types of wines as direct subclasses of the Wine class. This list\\nwould then include such more general types of wine as Beaujolais and Bordeaux, as well as\\nmore specific types such as Paulliac and Margaux (Figure 6a). The class Wine has too many\\ndirect subclasses and, indeed, for the ontology to reflect the different types of wine in a more\\norganized manner, Medoc should be a subclass of Bordeaux  and Cotes d’Or should be a\\n15subclass of Burgundy . Also having such intermediate categories as Red wine and White\\nwine would also reflect the conceptual model of the domain of wines that many people have\\n(Figure 6b).\\nHowever, if no natural classes exist to group concepts in the long list of siblings, there is no\\nneed to create artificial classes—just leave the classes the way they are. After all, the\\nontology is a reflection of the real world, and if no categorization exists in the real world,\\nthen the ontology should reflect that.\\nFigure 7. Categorizing wines. Having'),\n",

After all, the\\nontology is a reflection of the real world, and if no categorization exists in the real world,\\nthen the ontology should reflect that.\\nFigure 7. Categorizing wines. Having all the wines and types of wine versus having several levels of\\ncategorization.\\n4.3 Multiple inheritance\\nMost knowledge-representation systems allow multiple inheritance  in the class hierarchy:\\na class can be a subclass of several classes. Suppose we would like to create a separate class of\\ndessert wines, the Dessert wine class. The Port wine is both a red wine and a dessert\\n16wine.4 Therefore, we define a class Port to have two superclasses: Red wine and\\nDessert wine. All instances of the Port class will be instances of both the Red wine\\nclass and the Dessert wine class. The Port class will inherit its slots and their facets\\nfrom both its parents. Thus, it will inherit the value SWEET for the slot Sugar from the\\nDessert wine class and the tannin level slot and the value for its color slot from\\nthe Red wine class.\\n4.4 When to introduce a new class (or not)\\nOne of the hardest decisions to make during modeling is when to introduce a new class or\\nwhen to represent a distinction through different property values. It is hard to navigate both\\nan extremely nested hierarchy with many extraneous classes and a very flat hierarchy that\\nhas too few classes with too much information encoded in slots. Finding the appropriate\\nbalance though is not easy.\\nThere are several rules of thumb that help decide when to introduce new classes in a\\nhierarchy.\\nSubclasses of a class usually (1) have additional properties that the\\nsuperclass does not have, or (2) restrictions different from those of the\\nsuperclass, or (3) participate in different relationships than the\\nsuperclasses\\nRed wines can have different levels of tannin, whereas this property is not used to describe\\nwines in general. The value for the sugar slot of the Dessert wine is SWEET, whereas it is not\\ntrue of the superclass of the Dessert Wine class. Pinot Noir wines may go well with seafood\\nwhereas other red wines do not. In other words, we introduce a new class in the hierarchy\\nusually only when there is something that we can say about this class that we cannot say\\nabout the superclass.\\nIn practical terms, each subclass should either have new slots added to it, or have new slot\\nvalues defined, or override some facets for the inherited slots.\\nHowever, sometimes it may be useful to create new classes even if they do not introduce any\\nnew properties.\\nClasses in terminological hierarchies do not have to introduce new\\nproperties\\nFor example, some ontologies include large reference hierarchies of common terms used in\\nthe domain. For example, an ontology underlying an electronic medical-record system may\\ninclude a classification of various diseases. This classification may be just that—a hierarchy\\nof terms, without properties (or with the same set of properties). In that case, it is still useful\\nto organize the terms in a hierarchy rather than a flat list because it will (1) allow easier\\nexploration and navigation and (2) enable a doctor to choose easily a level of generality of\\nthe term that is appropriate for the situation.\\nAnother reason to introduce new classes without any new properties is to model concepts\\namong which domain experts commonly make a distinction even though we may have\\ndecided not to model the distinction itself. Since we use ontologies to facilitate\\ncommunication among domain experts and between domain experts and knowledge-based\\nsystems we would like to reflect the expert’s view of the domain in the ontology.\\nFinally, we should not create subclasses of a class for each additional restriction.  For\\nexample, we introduced the classes Red wine, White wine, and Rose wine  because\\nthis distinction is a natural one in the wine world. We did not introduce classes for delicate\\n                                                4 We chose to represent only red Ports in our ontology: white Ports do exist but they are extremely\\nuncommon.17wine, moderate wine, and so on. When defining a class hierarchy, our goal is to strike a\\nbalance between creating new classes useful for class organization and creating too many\\nclasses.\\n4.5 A new class or a property value?\\nWhen modeling a domain, we often need to decide whether to model a specific distinction\\n(such as white, red, or rosé wine) as a property value or as a set of classes again depends on\\nthe scope of the'),\n",

The answer usually lies in the scope that we defined for the\\nontology. How important the concept of White wine is in our domain? If wines have\\nonly marginal importance in the domain and whether or not the wine is white does not have\\nany particular implications for its relations to other objects, then we shouldn’t introduce a\\nseparate class for white wines. For a domain model used in a factory producing wine labels,\\nrules for wine labels of any color are the same and the distinction is not very important.\\nAlternatively, for the representation of wine, food, and their appropriate combinations a red\\nwine is very different from a white wine: it is paired with different foods, has different\\nproperties, and so on. Similarly, color of wine is important for the wines knowledge base that\\nwe may use to determine wine-tasting order.  Thus, we create a separate class for White\\nwine.\\nIf the concepts with different slot values become restrictions for different\\nslots in other classes, then we should create a new class for the distinction.\\nOtherwise, we represent the distinction in a slot value.\\nSimilarly, our wine ontology has such classes as Red Merlot and White Merlot, rather\\nthan a single class for all Merlot wines: red Merlots and white Merlots are really different\\nwines (made from the same grape) and if we are developing a detailed ontology of wine, this\\ndistinction is important.\\nIf a distinction is important in the domain and we think of the objects with\\ndifferent values for the distinction as different kinds of objects,  then we\\nshould create a new class for the distinction.\\nConsidering potential individual instances of a class may also be helpful in deciding whether\\nor not to introduce a new class.\\nA class to which an individual instance belongs should not change often.\\nUsually when we use extrinsic rather than intrinsic properties of concepts to differentiate\\namong classes, instances of those classes will have to migrate often from one class to\\nanother. For example, Chilled wine should not be a class in an ontology describing wine\\nbottles in a restaurant. The property chilled should simply be an attribute of wine in a\\nbottle since an instance of Chilled wine can easily cease being an instance of this class\\nand then become an instance of this class again.\\nUsually numbers, colors, locations are slot values and do not cause the creation of new\\nclasses. Wine, however, is a notable exception since the color of the wine is so paramount to\\nthe description of wine.\\nFor another example, consider the human-anatomy ontology. When we represent ribs, do we\\ncreate a class for each of the “1st left rib”, “2nd left rib”, and so on? Or do we have a class Rib\\nwith slots for the order and the lateral position (left-right)?5 If the information about each of\\nthe ribs that we represent in the ontology is significantly different, then we should indeed\\n                                                5 Here we assume that each anatomical organ is a class since we would also like to talk about “John’s 1st\\nleft rib.” Individual organs of existing people would be represented as individuals in our ontology.18create a class for each of the ribs. That is, if we want to represent details adjacency and\\nlocation information (which is different for each rib) as well as specific functions that each\\nrib playa and organs it protects, we want the classes. If we are modeling anatomy at a slightly\\nlesser level of generality, and all ribs are very similar as far as our potential applications are\\nconcerned (we just talk about which rib is broken on the X-Ray without implications for\\nother parts of the body), we may want to simplify our hierarchy and have just the class Rib,\\nwith two'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' (which is different for each rib) as well as specific functions that each\\nrib playa and organs it protects, we want the classes.

Deciding where classes end\\nand individual instances begin starts with deciding what is the lowest level of granularity in the\\nrepresentation. The level of granularity is in turn determined by a potential application of\\nthe ontology. In other words, what are the most specific items that are going to be\\nrepresented in the knowledge base? Going back to the competency questions we identified in\\nStep 1 in Section 3, the most specific concepts that will constitute answers to those questionsare very good candidates for individuals in the knowledge base.\\nIndividual instances are the most specific concepts represented in a\\nknowledge base.\\nFor example, if we are only going to talk about pairing wine with food we will not be\\ninterested in the specific physical bottles of wine. Therefore, such terms as Sterling\\nVineyards Merlot are probably going to be the most specific terms we use. In other\\nwords, the Wine class is a collection not of individual bottles of wines but rather of the\\nspecific wines produced by specific wineries. Therefore, Sterling Vineyards\\nMerlot would be an instance in the knowledge base.\\nOn the other hand, if we would like to maintain an inventory of wines in the restaurant in\\naddition to the knowledge base of good wine-food pairings, individual bottles of each wine\\nmay become individual instances in our knowledge base.\\nSimilarly, if we would like to record different properties for each specific vintage of the\\nSterling Vineyards Merlot, then the specific vintage of the wine is an instance in\\na knowledge base and Sterling Vineyards Merlot is a class containing instances for\\nall its vintages.\\nAnother rule can “move” some individual instances into the set of classes:\\nIf concepts form a natural hierarchy, then we should represent them as\\nclasses\\nConsider the wine regions. Initially, we may define main wine regions, such as France, United\\nStates, Germany, and so on, as classes and specific wine regions within these large regions as\\ninstances. For example, Bourgogne region is an instance of the French region\\nclass. However, we would also like to say that the Cotes d’Or region is a\\nBourgogne region. Therefore, Bourgogne region must be a class (in order to\\nhave subclasses or instances). However, making Bourgogne region a class and Cotes\\nd’Or region an instance of Bourgogne region seems arbitrary: it is very hard to\\nclearly distinguish which regions are classes and which are instances. Therefore, we define all\\nwine regions as classes. Protégé-2000 allows users to specify some classes as Abstract,\\nsignifying that the class cannot have any direct instances. In our case, all region classes are\\nabstract (Figure 8).19Figure 8. Hierarchy of wine regions. The \"A\" icons next to class names indicate that the classes are\\nabstract and cannot have any direct instances.\\nThe same class hierarchy would be incorrect if we omitted the word “region” from the class\\nnames. We cannot say that the class Alsace is a subclass of the class France: Alsace is\\nnot a kind of France. However, Alsace region is a kind of a French region.\\nOnly classes can be arranged in a hierarchy—knowledge-representation systems do not have a\\nnotion of sub-instance. Therefore, if there is a natural hierarchy among terms, such as in\\nterminological hierarchies from Section 4.2, we should define these terms as classes even\\nthough they may not have any instances of their own.\\n4.7 Limiting the scope\\nAs a final note on defining a class hierarchy, the following set of rules is always helpful in\\ndeciding when an ontology definition is complete:\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible information about the\\ndomain: you do not need to specialize (or generalize) more than you need\\nfor your application (at most one extra level each way).\\nFor our wine and food example, we do not need to know what paper is used for the labels or\\nhow to cook shrimp dishes.\\nSimilarly,\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible properties of and\\ndistinctions among classes in the hierarchy.\\nIn our ontology, we certainly do not'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=':\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible information about the\\ndomain: you do not need to specialize (or generalize) more than you need\\nfor your application (at most one extra level each way).\\nFor our wine and food example, we do not need to know what paper is used for the labels or\\nhow to cook shrimp dishes.\\nSimilarly,\\nThe ontology should not contain all the possible properties of and\\ndistinctions among classes in the hierarchy.\\nIn our ontology, we certainly do not include all the properties that a wine or food could have.\\nWe represented the most salient properties of the classes of items in our ontology.  Even\\nthough wine books would tell us the size of grapes, we have not included this knowledge.\\nSimilarly, we have not added all relationships that one could imagine among all the terms in\\nour system.  For example, we do not include relationships such as favorite wine and\\nfavorite food in the ontology just to allow a more complete representation of all of\\nthe interconnections between the terms we have defined.\\nThe last rule also applies to establishing relations among concepts that we have already\\nincluded in the ontology. Consider an ontology describing biology experiments. The ontology\\nwill likely contain a concept of Biological organisms . It will also contain a concept\\nof an Experimenter  performing an experiment (with his name, affiliation, etc.). It is true\\n20that an experimenter, as a person, also happens to be a biological organism. However, we\\nprobably should not incorporate this distinction in the ontology: for the purposes of this\\nrepresentation an experimenter is not a biological organism and we will probably never\\nconduct experiments on the experimenters themselves. If we were representing everything\\nwe can say about the classes in the ontology, an Experimenter  would become a subclass\\nof Biological Organism . However, we do not need to include this knowledge for the\\nforeseeable applications. In fact, including this type of additional classification for existing\\nclasses actually hurts: now an instance of an Experimenter will have slots for weight, age,\\nspecies, and other data pertaining to a  biological organism, but absolutely irrelevant in the\\ncontext of describing an experiment. However, we should record such design decision in the\\ndocumentation for the benefit of the users who will be looking at this ontology and who may\\nnot be aware of the application we had in mind.  Otherwise, people intending to reuse the\\nontology for other applications may try to use experimenter as a subclass of person without\\nknowing that the original modeling did not include that fact.\\n4.8 Disjoint subclasses\\nMany systems allow us to specify explicitly that several classes are disjoint . Classes are\\ndisjoint if they cannot have any instances in common. For example, the Dessert wine\\nand the White wine  classes in our ontology are not disjoint: there are many wines that\\nare instances of both. The Rothermel Trochenbierenauslese Riesling\\ninstance of the Sweet Riesling  class is one such example. At the same time, the Red\\nwine and the White wine classes are disjoint: no wine can be simultaneously red and\\nwhite. Specifying that classes are disjoint enables the system to validate the ontology better.\\nIf we declare the Red wine and the White wine classes to be disjoint and later create a\\nclass that is a subclass of both Riesling  (a subclass of White wine) and Port (a\\nsubclass of Red wine), a system can indicate that there is a modeling error.\\n5 Defining properties—more details\\nIn this section we discuss several more details to keep in mind when defining slots in the\\nontology (Step 5 and Step 6 in Section 3). Mainly, we discuss inverse slots and default values\\nfor a slot.\\n5.1 Inverse slots\\nA value of a slot may depend on a value of another slot. For example, if a wine was\\nproduced by a winery, then the winery produces  that wine. These two relations,\\nmaker and produces , are called inverse relations . Storing the information “in both\\ndirections” is redundant. When we know that a wine is produced by a winery, an application\\nusing the knowledge base can always infer the value for the inverse relation that the winery\\nproduces the wine. However, from the knowledge-acquisition perspective it is convenient to\\nhave both pieces of information explicitly available. This approach allows users to fill in the\\nwine in one case and the winery in another. The knowledge-acquisition system could then\\nautomatically fill in the value for the inverse relation insuring consistency of the knowledge\\nbase.\\nOur example has a pair of inverse slots: the maker slot of the Wine class and the\\nproduces  slot of the Winery class. When a user creates an instance of the Wine class\\nand'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' is convenient to\\nhave both pieces of information explicitly available. This approach allows users to fill in the\\nwine in one case and the winery in another. The knowledge-acquisition system could then\\nautomatically fill in the value for the inverse relation insuring consistency of the knowledge\\nbase.\\nOur example has a pair of inverse slots: the maker slot of the Wine class and the\\nproduces  slot of the Winery class. When a user creates an instance of the Wine class\\nand fills in the value for the maker slot, the system automatically adds the newly created\\ninstance to the produces  slot of the corresponding Winery instance. For instance, when\\nwe say that Sterling Merlot is produced by the Sterling Vineyard winery, the system would21automatically add Sterling Merlot to the list of wines that the Sterling Vineyard winery\\nproduces. (Figure 9).\\nFigure 9. Instances with inverse slots. The slot produces  for the class Winery is an inverse of the\\nslot  maker for the class Wine. Filling in one of the slots triggers an automatic update of the other.\\n5.2 Default values\\nMany frame-based systems allow specification of default values for slots.  If a particular slot\\nvalue is the same for most instances of a class, we can define this value to be a default  value\\nfor the slot. Then, when each new instance of a class containing this slot is created, the\\nsystem fills in the default value automatically. We can then change the value to any other\\nvalue that the facets will allow. That is, default values are there for convenience: they do not\\nenforce any new restrictions on the model or change the model in any way.\\nFor example, if the majority of wines we are going to discuss are full-bodied wines, we can\\nhave “full” as a default value for the body of the wine. Then, unless we say otherwise, all\\nwines we define would be full-bodied.\\nNote that this is different from  slot values . Slot values cannot be changed. For example, we\\ncan say that the slot sugar has value SWEET for the Dessert wine class. Then all the\\nsubclasses and instances of the Dessert wine class will have the SWEET value for the\\nslot sugar. This value cannot be changed in any of the subclasses or instances of the class.\\n6 What’s in a name?\\nDefining naming conventions for concepts in an ontology and then strictly adhering to these\\nconventions not only makes the ontology easier to understand but also helps avoid some\\ncommon modeling mistakes. There are many alternatives in naming concepts. Often there is\\nno particular reason to choose one or another alternative. However, we need to\\nDefine a naming convention for classes and slots and adhere to it.\\nThe following features of a knowledge representation system affect the choice of naming\\n22conventions:\\n• Does the system have the same name space for classes, slots, and instances? That is,\\ndoes the system allow having a class and a slot with the same name (such as a class\\nwinery and a slot winery)?\\n• Is the system case-sensitive? That is, does the system treat the names that differ only\\nin case as different names (such as Winery and winery)?\\n• What delimiters does the system allow in the names? That is, can names contain\\nspaces, commas, asterisks, and so on?\\nProtégé-2000, for example, maintains a single name space for all its frames. It is case-\\nsensitive. Thus, we cannot have a class winery and a slot winery. We can, however, have\\na class Winery (note the upper-case) and a slot winery. CLASSIC, on the other hand, is\\nnot case sensitive and maintains different name spaces for classes, slots, and individuals.\\nThus, from a system perspective, there is no problem in naming both a class and a slot\\nWinery.\\n6.1 Capitalization and delimiters\\nFirst, we can greatly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent\\ncapitalization for concept names. For example, it is common to capitalize class names and\\nuse lower case for slot names (assuming the system is case-sensitive).\\nWhen a concept name contains more than one word (such as Meal course) we need to\\ndelimit the words. Here are some possible choices.\\n• Use Space: Meal course (many systems, including Protégé, allow spaces in\\nconcept names).  \\n• Run the words together and capitalize each new word: MealCourse\\n• Use an underscore or dash or other delimiter in the name: Meal_Course ,\\nMeal_course , Meal-Course , Meal-course . (If you use delimiters, you will\\nalso need to decide whether or not each new word is capitalized)\\nIf the knowledge-representation system allows spaces in'),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' some possible choices.\\n• Use Space: Meal course (many systems, including Protégé, allow spaces in\\nconcept names).  \\n• Run the words together and capitalize each new word: MealCourse\\n• Use an underscore or dash or other delimiter in the name: Meal_Course ,\\nMeal_course , Meal-Course , Meal-course . (If you use delimiters, you will\\nalso need to decide whether or not each new word is capitalized)\\nIf the knowledge-representation system allows spaces in names, using them may be the most\\nintuitive solution for many ontology developers. It is however, important to consider other\\nsystems with which your system may interact.  If those systems do not use spaces or if your\\npresentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method.\\n6.2 Singular or plural\\nA class name represents a collection of objects. For example, a class Wine actually\\nrepresents all wines. Therefore, it could be more natural for some designers to call the class\\nWines rather than Wine. No alternative is better or worse than the other (although singular\\nfor class names is used more often in practice). However, whatever the choice, it should be\\nconsistent throughout the whole ontology. Some systems even require their users to declare\\nin advance whether or not they are going to use singular or plural for concept names and do\\nnot allow them to stray from that choice.\\nUsing the same form all the time also prevents a designer from making such modeling\\nmistakes as creating a class Wines and then creating a class Wine as its subclass (see Section\\n4.1).\\n6.3 Prefix and suffix conventions\\nSome knowledge-base methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in the names\\nto distinguish between classes and slots.  Two common practices are to add a has- or a suffix\\n–of to slot names.  Thus, our slots become has-maker  and has-winery  if we chose the23has- convention. The slots become maker-of  and winery-of  if we chose the of-\\nconvention.  This approach allows anyone looking at a term to determine immediately if the\\nterm is a class or a slot.  However, the term names become slightly longer.\\n6.4 Other naming considerations\\nHere are a few more things to consider when defining naming conventions:\\n• Do not add strings such as “class”, “property”, “slot”, and so on to concept names.\\nIt is always clear form the context whether the concept is a class or a slot, for example. In\\naddition is you use different naming conventions for classes and slots (say, capitalization and\\nno capitalization respectively), the name itself would be indicative of what the concept is.\\n• It is usually a good idea to avoid abbreviations in concept names (that is, use\\nCabernet Sauvignon  rather than Cab)\\n• Names of direct subclasses of a class should either all include or not include the name\\nof the superclass. For example, if we are creating two subclasses of the Wine class to\\nrepresent red and white wines, the two subclass names should be either Red Wine\\nand White Wine or Red and White, but not Red Wine and White.\\n7 Other Resources\\nWe have used Protégé-2000 as an ontology-developing environment for our examples.\\nDuineveld and colleagues (Duineveld et al. 2000)  describe and compare a number of other\\nontology-development environments.  \\nWe have tried to address the very basics of ontology development and have not discussed\\nmany of the advanced topics or alternative methodologies for ontology development.\\nGómez-Pérez (Gómez-Pérez 1998)  and Uschold (Uschold and Gruninger 1996)  present\\nalternative ontology-development methodologies. The Ontolingua tutorial (Farquhar 1997)\\ndiscusses some formal aspects of knowledge modeling.   \\nCurrently, researchers emphasize not only ontology development, but also ontology analysis.\\nAs more ontologies are generated and reused, more tools will be available to analyze\\nontologies. For example, Chimaera (McGuinness et al. 2000)  provides diagnostic tools for\\nanalyzing ontologies. The analysis that Chimaera performs includes both a check for logical\\ncorrectness of an ontology and diagnostics of common ontology-design errors. An ontology\\ndesigner may want to run Chimaera diagnostics over the evolving ontology to determine the\\nconformance to common ontology-modeling practices.\\n8 Conclusions\\nIn this guide, we have described an ontology-development methodology for declarative\\nframe-based systems. We listed the steps in the ontology-development process and addressed\\nthe complex issues of defining class hierarchies and properties of classes and instances.\\nHowever, after following all the rules and suggestions, one of the most important things to\\nremember is the following: there is no single correct'),\n",

      "Artificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have\n",

      "taxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for\n",
      "sale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is\n",
      "developing the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for\n",
      "encoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching\n",
      "for information.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in\n",
      "conjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by\n",
      "extending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the\n",
      "Web (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies\n",
      "that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for\n",
      "example, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED  (Price and\n",
      "Spackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System\n",
      "(Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For\n",
      "example, the United Nations Development Program and Dun & Bradstreet combined their\n",
      "efforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and\n",
      "services (www.unspsc.org).\n",
      "An ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in\n",
      "a domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and\n",
      "relations among them.\n",
      "Why would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:\n",
      "• To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or\n",
      "software agents\n",
      "• To enable reuse of domain knowledge\n",
      "• To make domain assumptions explicit\n",
      "• To separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge\n",
      "• To analyze domain knowledge\n",
      "Sharing common understanding of the structure of information among people or software\n",
      "agents  is one of the more common goals in developing ontologies (Musen 1992; Gruber\n",
      "1993). For example, suppose several different Web sites contain medical information or\n",
      "provide medical e-commerce services. If these Web sites share and publish the same\n",
      "underlying ontology of the terms they all use, then computer agents can extract and\n",
      "aggregate information from these different sites. The agents can use this aggregated\n",
      "information to answer user queries or as input data to other applications.\n",
      "Enabling reuse of domain knowledge  was one of the driving forces behind recent surge in\n",
      "ontology research. For example, models for many different domains need to represent the\n",
      "notion of time. This representation includes the notions of time intervals, points in time,\n",
      "relative measures of time, and so on. If one group of researchers develops such an ontology\n",
      "in detail, others can simply reuse it for their domains. Additionally, if we need to build a large2ontology, we can integrate several existing ontologies describing portions of the large\n",
      "domain. We can also reuse a general ontology, such as the UNSPSC ontology, and extend it\n",
      "to describe our domain of interest.\n",
      "Making explicit domain assumptions underlying an implementation makes it possible to\n",
      "change these assumptions easily if our knowledge about the domain changes. Hard-coding\n",
      "assumptions about the world in programming-language code makes these assumptions not\n",
      "only hard to find and understand but also hard to change, in particular for someone without\n",
      "programming expertise. In addition, explicit specifications of domain knowledge are useful\n",
      "for new users who must learn what terms in the domain mean.  \n",
      "Separating the domain knowledge from the operational knowledge is another common use\n",
      "of ontologies. We can describe a task of configuring a product from its components according\n",
      "to a required specification and implement a program that does this configuration independent\n",

      "We build on our experience using Protégé-2000 (Protege 2000) , Ontolingua (Ontolingua\n",
      "1997) , and Chimaera (Chimaera 2000)  as ontology-editing environments. In this guide, we\n",

      "details. Along the way, we discuss the modeling decisions that a designer needs to make, as\n",
      "well as the pros, cons, and implications of different solutions.\n",
      "First, we would like to emphasize some fundamental rules in ontology design to which we will\n",
      "refer many times. These rules may seem rather dogmatic. They can help, however, to make\n",
      "design decisions in many cases.\n",
      "1) There is no one correct way to model a domain— there are always\n",
      "viable alternatives. The best solution almost always depends on the\n",
      "application that you have in mind and the extensions that you anticipate.\n",
      "2) Ontology development is necessarily an iterative process.\n",

      "4.1 Ensuring that the class hierarchy is correct\n",
      "An “is-a” relation\n",
      "The class hierarchy represents an “is-a” relation: a class A is a subclass of B if every instance\n",
      "of A is also an instance of B. For example, Chardonnay  is a subclass of White wine.\n",
      "Another way to think of the taxonomic relation is as a “kind-of” relation: Chardonnay  is\n",

      "A single wine is not a subclass of all wines\n",

      "Transitivity of the hierarchical relations\n",
      "A subclass relationship is transitive:\n",
      "If B is a subclass of A and C is a subclass of B, then C is a subclass of A\n",

      "are instances of both. The Rothermel Trochenbierenauslese Riesling\n",
      "instance of the Sweet Riesling  class is one such example. At the same time, the Red\n",
      "wine and the White wine classes are disjoint: no wine can be simultaneously red and\n",
      "white. Specifying that classes are disjoint enables the system to validate the ontology better.\n",
      "If we declare the Red wine and the White wine classes to be disjoint and later create a\n",
      "class that is a subclass of both Riesling  (a subclass of White wine) and Port (a\n",

      "does the system allow having a class and a slot with the same name (such as a class\n",

      "• Is the system case-sensitive? That is, does the system treat the names that differ only\n",

      "• What delimiters does the system allow in the names? That is, can names contain\n",

      "Protégé-2000, for example, maintains a single name space for all its frames. It is case-\n",
      "sensitive. Thus, we cannot have a class winery and a slot winery. We can, however, have\n",

      "not case sensitive and maintains different name spaces for classes, slots, and individuals.\n",
      "Thus, from a system perspective, there is no problem in naming both a class and a slot\n",

      "6.1 Capitalization and delimiters\n",

      "systems with which your system may interact.  If those systems do not use spaces or if your\n",
      "presentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method.\n",
      "6.2 Singular or plural\n",
      "A class name represents a collection of objects. For example, a class Wine actually\n",
      "represents all wines. Therefore, it could be more natural for some designers to call the class\n",
      "Wines rather than Wine. No alternative is better or worse than the other (although singular\n",
      "for class names is used more often in practice). However, whatever the choice, it should be\n",
      "consistent throughout the whole ontology. Some systems even require their users to declare\n",
      "in advance whether or not they are going to use singular or plural for concept names and do\n",
      "not allow them to stray from that choice.\n",
      "Using the same form all the time also prevents a designer from making such modeling\n",
      "mistakes as creating a class Wines and then creating a class Wine as its subclass (see Section\n",
      "4.1).\n",
      "6.3 Prefix and suffix conventions\n",
      "Some knowledge-base methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in the names\n",
      "to distinguish between classes and slots.  Two common practices are to add a has- or a suffix\n",
      "–of to slot names.  Thus, our slots become has-maker  and has-winery  if we chose the23has- convention. The slots become maker-of  and winery-of  if we chose the of-\n",
      "convention.  This approach allows anyone looking at a term to determine immediately if the\n",
      "term is a class or a slot.  However, the term names become slightly longer.\n",
      "6.4 Other naming considerations\n",
      "Here are a few more things to consider when defining naming conventions:\n",
      "• Do not add strings such as “class”, “property”, “slot”, and so on to concept names.\n",
      "It is always clear form the context whether the concept is a class or a slot, for example. In\n",
      "addition is you use different naming conventions for classes and slots (say, capitalization and\n",
      "no capitalization respectively), the name itself would be indicative of what the concept is.\n",
      "• It is usually a good idea to avoid abbreviations in concept names (that is, use\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon  rather than Cab)\n",
      "• Names of direct subclasses of a class should either all include or not include the name\n",
      "of the superclass. For example, if we are creating two subclasses of the Wine class to\n",
      "represent red and white wines, the two subclass names should be either Red Wine\n",

      "Question:: 1. What is the formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse known as ontology?\n",
      "Answer:: An ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts and relations among them.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 2. Who is the developer of the knowledge-representation system CLASSIC?\n",
      "Answer:: The knowledge-representation system CLASSIC was developed by Richard J. Brachman, Deborah L. McGuinness, Peter F. Patel-Schneider, Lori A. Resnick, and Alex Borgida.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 3. Can you name some ontology-editing environments discussed in the document?\n",
      "Answer:: Some of the ontology-editing environments discussed in the document are Protégé-2000, Ontolingua, and Chimaera.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 4. What is the typical method of describing classes in ontologies?\n",
      "Answer:: In ontologies, classes are typically described by defining concepts in a domain. This involves specifying the properties and attributes of each concept, such as relationships, features, and restrictions. Classes are organized in a hierarchical taxonomy, with subclasses representing more specific concepts than their superclasses. The descriptions of classes include defining slots, which describe the properties of classes and instances. The facets of slots, such as value type, cardinality, and range, provide additional details about the properties of classes in the ontology.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 5. How would you differentiate between an ontology and a knowledge base?\n",
      "Answer:: An ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain, including classes, properties, and restrictions on slots. It defines the structure of information in a domain and the relationships among concepts. On the other hand, a knowledge base is a collection of individual instances of classes in an ontology. It constitutes the actual data or information stored in a structured format based on the ontology. In simpler terms, an ontology defines the structure and relationships of concepts, while a knowledge base contains the specific data or instances related to those concepts.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 6. How are subclasses utilized in ontology development?\n",
      "Answer:: Subclasses are used in ontology development to represent concepts that are more specific than their superclass. They help to organize and categorize information in a hierarchical structure. Subclasses inherit properties and relationships from their superclasses, allowing for a more detailed and structured representation of the domain. By defining subclasses, ontology developers can capture the nuances and distinctions within a domain, making the ontology more precise and informative.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 7. What is the role of slots in ontology descriptions?\n",
      "Answer:: In ontology descriptions, slots play a crucial role in defining the properties of classes and instances. Slots are used to describe the attributes, features, or relationships of concepts in the domain. They provide a structured way to capture information about the entities being modeled in the ontology. Slots define the characteristics of classes and instances, such as their properties, relationships, and constraints. By defining slots, ontology developers can create a detailed and organized representation of the domain, enabling better understanding and utilization of the ontology.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 8. What sets ontology development apart from class design in object-oriented programming?\n",
      "Answer:: Ontology development and class design in object-oriented programming share some similarities, but they also have distinct differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Purpose**: \n",
      "   - **Ontology Development**: Ontology development focuses on creating a formal, explicit description of concepts in a domain to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. It is used to represent knowledge in a structured way for various applications.\n",
      "   - **Class Design in OOP**: Class design in object-oriented programming is primarily concerned with defining classes, their attributes, and methods to model the behavior of software systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scope**:\n",
      "   - **Ontology Development**: Ontology development often involves a broader scope, encompassing various concepts, relationships, and properties in a domain. It aims to capture knowledge in a domain comprehensively.\n",
      "   - **Class Design in OOP**: Class design in OOP is more focused on designing classes that represent objects and their interactions within a specific software system.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Abstraction Level**:\n",
      "   - **Ontology Development**: Ontology development typically operates at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with concepts, relationships, and properties that are domain-specific and independent of implementation details.\n",
      "   - **Class Design in OOP**: Class design in OOP is more concrete and implementation-oriented, focusing on defining classes, attributes, and methods that directly relate to the software system being developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Interoperability**:\n",
      "   - **Ontology Development**: Ontologies are often designed to be shared and reused across different systems and applications. They aim to provide a common understanding and vocabulary for knowledge representation.\n",
      "   - **Class Design in OOP**: Classes in object-oriented programming are specific to the software system being developed and are not necessarily designed for interoperability with other systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Analysis vs. Implementation**:\n",
      "   - **Ontology Development**: Ontology development involves analyzing domain knowledge, defining concepts, and capturing relationships. It is more about knowledge representation and analysis.\n",
      "  \n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 9. Can you provide some sources for alternative ontology-design methodologies as discussed in the document?\n",
      "Answer:: Some sources for alternative ontology-design methodologies as discussed in the document are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Gómez-Pérez, A. (1998). Knowledge sharing and reuse. Handbook of Applied Expert Systems.\n",
      "2. Gruninger, M. and Fox, M.S. (1995). Methodology for the Design and Evaluation of Ontologies.\n",

      "5. Uschold, M. and Gruninger, M. (1996). Ontologies: Principles, Methods and Applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "These sources can provide more in-depth information and guidance on ontology-design methodologies.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 10. What is the primary focus of the majority of ontologies?\n",
      "Answer:: The primary focus of the majority of ontologies is to define a common vocabulary for researchers to share information in a domain. Ontologies include machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. They are used to share common understanding of the structure of information among people or software agents.\n",
      "--------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:: 11. How should the range and domain of a slot be defined in ontology development?\n",
      "Answer:: In ontology development, the range and domain of a slot should be defined carefully to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the ontology. Here are some guidelines for defining the range and domain of a slot:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Range of a Slot**: The range of a slot defines the set of classes that can be used as values for that slot. It specifies the types of instances that can fill the slot. When defining the range of a slot, consider the following:\n",
      "   - Choose the most specific classes that can be values for the slot.\n",
      "   - Avoid overly general classes as the range, as this can lead to ambiguity.\n",
      "   - Ensure that all classes in the range can be described by the slot.\n",
      "   - Remove subclasses if the superclass is already included in the range.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Domain of a Slot**: The domain of a slot specifies the classes to which the slot is attached. It defines the context in which the slot is valid. When defining the domain of a slot, consider the following:\n",
      "   - Choose the most general classes that can have the property described by the slot.\n",
      "   - Avoid overly specific classes as the domain, as this can limit the applicability of the slot.\n",
      "   - Ensure that all classes in the domain can have the property represented by the slot.\n",
      "   - Avoid cycles in the domain hierarchy to prevent modeling errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully defining the range and domain of slots in an ontology, you can ensure that the ontology accurately represents the relationships and properties of the concepts in the domain.\n",
